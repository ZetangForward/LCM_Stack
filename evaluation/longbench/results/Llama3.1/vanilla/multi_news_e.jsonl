The report, which took four years to compose and cost $40 million, details how the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the use of interrogation techniques that many experts consider torture.\n\nThe CIA has been accused of monitoring computers used by Senate aides to prepare the report, which may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency. The CIA Inspector General's Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate the allegations of malfeasance. The monitoring is believed to have occurred in a secure room at CIA headquarters where the agency provided intelligence committee staff with access to millions of pages of top-secret reports, cables, and other documents.\n\nThe dispute has led to a breakdown in relations between the CIA and its congressional overseers, with the committee's chairman, Sen. Mark Udall, urging President Barack Obama to strip the CIA of control over the declassification of the report.

These proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, thereby preventing the fish from freezing over. However, a recent study has revealed a paradoxical consequence of this adaptation: the AFPs also inhibit the melting of ice crystals, leading to their accumulation in the fish's body.\n\nResearchers have found that the AFPs prevent ice crystals from melting even at temperatures above the expected melting point, a phenomenon known as \"superheating.\" This means that the fish are unable to rid themselves of the ice crystals, which can accumulate in their bodies over time. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the AFPs may be responsible for the fish's ability to survive in the cold waters, but also poses a risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals.\n\nThe researchers, led by Paul Cziko, a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon, used a combination of laboratory experiments and field observations to study the behavior of AFPs in notothenioid fish. They found that the ice crystals persisted in the fish's bodies even after being warmed to temperatures above the expected melting point, and that the AFPs were responsible for this phenomenon.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of antifreeze proteins and the adaptation of notothenioid fish to their environment. While the AFPs have clearly been beneficial for the fish's survival, they also come with a hidden cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of internal ice crystals. This highlights the complex and often counterintuitive nature of evolutionary adaptations, where seemingly beneficial traits can have unintended consequences.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the fish may have evolved mechanisms to deal with the accumulated ice crystals, such as filtering them out of the blood in the spleen. However, the long-term effects of this adaptation are still unknown and require further research. The study provides a fascinating example of the intricate and often surprising ways in which living organisms adapt to their environments, and highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of evolutionary innovations.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

This decline has significant implications for the marine ecosystem, as sardines are a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has been urged to take action to protect the sardine population, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species.\n\nThe sardine population has been in decline since 2006, with a 72% drop in population since its last peak. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in over a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline has led to steep cuts in fishing quotas, but some environmental groups are calling for a complete halt to sardine fishing.\n\nScientists are unsure of the cause of the decline, but point to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines. However, the decline is also raising concerns about overfishing and the impact of fishing on the ecosystem.\n\nThe decline of sardines is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with many species, including sea lions, brown pelicans, and other predators, struggling to find food. In 2013, over 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups washed up on beaches, with research suggesting that the scarcity of sardines was a contributing factor.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is a boom-bust fish, with populations fluctuating wildly in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. However, the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. If the population does not recover soon, experts warn that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years.\n\nThe PFMC has been urged to take action to protect the sardine population, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species.

Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)\u2014and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

With accusations that Get Hard is homophobic and racist, Ferrell defends the flick to the AP, noting he and costar Kevin Hart \"show a mirror to what's already existing out there.\" Do critics agree? \"Perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but Get Hard is not it,\" Claudia Puig writes at USA Today.

Instead, it's \"weighed down by middle-school jokes.\" At its best, Get Hard \"does a smartly scathing job\" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post.

This change aims to speed up the game, but not everyone is pleased with the decision.\n\nThe new rule, which was approved for the current season, eliminates the possibility of a batter scoring on an errant pitch during an intentional walk, as previously seen in instances where the pitcher threw the ball too close to the strike zone. However, some players and fans are nostalgic for the old way, citing the excitement of a botched intentional walk.\n\nThe change is expected to have a minimal impact on the game's pace, as intentional walks already account for a small portion of game time.

According to various studies and reports, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to the development of \"superbugs\" that are resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to human health, with at least 2 million people getting an antibiotic-resistant infection and at least 23,000 people dying each year in the United States.\n\n**The Extent of the Problem**\n\nA study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics in the United States are not needed. This translates to approximately 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year. The majority of these prescriptions are for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* About 13% of all outpatient visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription, with approximately 154 million visits annually.\n* More than 40% of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia.\n* Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\n**The Consequences of Antibiotic Overuse**\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics has led to the rise of drug-resistant superbugs, which pose a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. The CDC has warned that \"nightmare bacteria\" are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. If left unchecked, antibiotic resistance could undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections, cancer, and other life-threatening conditions.\n\n**The Need for Action**\n\nTo combat antibiotic resistance, the White House has set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020. Based on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15% overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. To achieve this goal, health care providers, patients, and the health care industry must work together to improve prescribing practices and reduce the misuse of antibiotics.\n\n**Recommendations for Change**\n\n* Health care providers can evaluate their own prescribing", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2014the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post\u2014isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections\u2014meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 3153}

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says. More than 80 years after his death, Rosenwald still inspires. \"Not all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,\" says Kempner, but \"we can all do something.\""], "length": 2028}

Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was murdered on a street in Woolwich, south-east London, on Wednesday afternoon. The two suspects, Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were known to MI5 and had been under surveillance for eight years. Despite this, they were able to carry out the attack, which was filmed by a passer-by.\n\nThe suspects, who were shot and arrested by police, had been planning to ambush and murder the first police officers to arrive at the scene. A dramatic video obtained by the Daily Mirror shows the suspects, one wielding a cleaver and the other a handgun, charging at police officers. The footage reveals how the suspects had lured police to the scene by dragging the body of the murdered soldier into the middle of the road.\n\nThe attack has sparked a debate over how to confront extremism in Britain, which has spent significant resources on enhancing its security and counterterrorism network in the wake of the 2005 coordinated suicide attacks. Prime Minister David Cameron has condemned the attack, saying that the perpetrators were trying to divide the nation, but that it would only bring people together and make them stronger.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has also condemned the attack, calling it a \"barbaric act that has no basis in Islam.\" The two suspects are currently under armed guard in separate London hospitals, where they are being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe investigation into the attack is ongoing, with police making two further arrests on Thursday, a 29-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, on suspicion of conspiring to murder. The police have also searched six residential addresses across London and in Lincolnshire, England.\n\nThe suspects had previously surfaced in security service probes into Islamist extremists, but it is unclear why they were not stopped. The attack has raised questions about the effectiveness of the UK's security services and the need for greater vigilance in the face of extremist threats.\n\nThe victim, Drummer Rigby, was a 25-year-old soldier who had served in Afghanistan, Germany, and Cyprus.

The Ms. Foundation's original mission has been accomplished, and now it's essential to take girls to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work. This is crucial because women's rates of top leadership have barely budged in the past two decades, despite representing half the US workforce.\n\nThe problem lies not in a lack of ambition, but in a lack of encouragement and opportunities. Companies need to do more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the \"ambition gap.\" Introducing girls to female role models, explaining what leaders do on a day-to-day basis, and supporting programs that identify and groom female talent are essential steps.\n\nResearch by the Girl Scouts found that 80% of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60% have not been offered the opportunity to see them in action. Companies can help by introducing their employees' daughters to women at the highest level of the company and highlighting their accomplishments. This will give girls a better understanding of the responsibilities, roles, and payoffs of leadership, making it more tangible and achievable.\n\nHowever, simply showing girls what an office looks like is no longer enough. Real breakthroughs will come when we bring girls inside the halls of power. Companies and schools need proactive efforts to move women into leadership roles. Princeton University's success in increasing the number of female students winning top academic honors and holding visible leadership roles is a model for this approach.\n\nIn corporate environments, sponsorship is key. Sponsors spend their political capital on behalf of their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, providing opportunities instead of merely advice. The best companies for diversity have formal sponsorship initiatives to achieve similar results.\n\nUltimately, it's time to take our daughters to the C-suite, where they can lead in the future. By doing so, we can close the leadership gap, tap into the talent of half the workforce, and promote fairness and social equality.", "answers": ["Today is the 20th anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, and Jennifer Allyn at the Christian Science Monitor says it's time to declare mission accomplished and refocus on a bigger goal.

Now it's time to introduce girls to the executive suites, to give them role models of women as decision-makers.

The legislation, which was voted through by 329 deputies to 229, with 10 abstentions, must now be passed by the Senate before it can become law.\n\nThe bill, which redefines marriage as a contract between two people rather than between a man and a woman, has been a contentious issue in France, with the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups opposing it. However, it has won the support of gay rights advocates, who see it as a major advance for equality of rights.\n\nThe bill is part of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's first major social reform, and it is expected to be approved by the left-wing-controlled Senate on April 2. If passed, France will join 11 other countries that allow same-sex marriage, including Spain, Sweden, South Africa, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe issue has sparked large protests in France, with around 340,000 people turning out in Paris to protest the reform. The anti-gay marriage camp, largely driven by the Catholic Church, has accused President Hollande of pushing through legislation without proper consultation.\n\nThe bill has also been a topic of debate in other countries, including the UK, where lawmakers have recently voted for marriage equality, and the US, where same-sex marriage has been legalized in nine states and the District of Columbia.

The legislation has been amended to exclude provisions for same-sex couples to access medically assisted procreation, which will be debated separately later in the year.\n\nOverall, the approval of the bill in France is a major victory for gay rights advocates, but it is also a reminder of the ongoing debate and controversy surrounding same-sex marriage around the world.", "answers": ["Same-sex marriage is now just one step away from being legal in France.

Nine women in Sweden have received transplanted wombs since 2012, with four of them having embryos transferred in an attempt to get pregnant. The women, who were either born without a uterus or lost it due to cancer, underwent the procedure using wombs donated by their mothers or close relatives.\n\nThe transplants are part of an experimental procedure designed to test whether it's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during the day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is a significant finding, as it suggests that homeowners with west-facing solar panels can reduce their peak energy usage by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's lead researcher, Brewster McCracken, explained that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy in the late afternoon, which coincides with the time when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, increasing their energy usage. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are optimizing their solar power generation at the exact time when their energy usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.\n\nThe study's findings have the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market, as it opens up the possibility of installing solar panels on homes with west-facing roofs, which were previously thought to be unsuitable for solar installations. Additionally, the study suggests that utility companies may need to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, as they can help reduce the stress on the grid during peak demand periods.\n\nWhile the study's results are promising, it's essential to note that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's unclear how the results would translate to other seasons. However, the study's findings are consistent with a previous study by the California Public Utility Commission, which found that west-facing systems were more effective at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones.\n\nThe study's results have sparked debate among experts, with some arguing that the benefits of west-facing panels may vary depending on the region and the structure of incentives provided by utility companies.

She also emphasized the importance of self-awareness in her career, saying that she tries to preserve it despite the pressures of fame.\n\nSwift also discussed her song \"Bad Blood,\" which many people believe is about her feud with Katy Perry. However, Swift claimed that the song is actually about the loss of a friendship, and that she deliberately said it was about losing a friend in an interview to divert attention away from the more personal interpretation. She also revealed that she closely monitors what people say about her online, and that she has a strategy for managing her public image.\n\nIn another interview with GQ, Swift spoke about her personal life and how it intersects with her career. She discussed her lack of female friendships in high school and middle school, which she believes is why her female friendships are so important to her now. She also talked about her experience with loneliness, saying that she doesn't feel lonely despite being around people all the time, and that she has learned to appreciate the fleeting moments of happiness in her life.\n\nSwift also addressed the infamous incident at the 2009 VMAs when Kanye West stormed the stage during her acceptance speech. She revealed that she was initially hurt by the crowd's booing, but that she has since made amends with West and values their friendship.\n\nThroughout the interviews, Swift came across as self-aware and calculated, but also vulnerable and genuine.

However, 41% of voters still have not made up their minds, indicating that the outcome is far from certain.\n\nRomney, the current front-runner, is banking on his electability as a key factor in his success. He has poured significant resources into Iowa and is expected to perform well, particularly in areas with high turnout. However, a poor showing could raise questions about his ability to win over the Republican base.\n\nRon Paul, on the other hand, is relying on his army of college activists and a strong ground game to propel him to victory. His campaign has been boosted by a surge in popularity, despite facing criticism for his past publication of a racist and anti-Semitic newsletter. Paul's message of liberty and limited government has resonated with many young voters and independents.\n\nRick Santorum, a Christian conservative from Pennsylvania, has seen a surge in popularity in recent days, particularly among social conservatives and evangelicals. He has raised more money in the last few days than in the previous few months and is expected to perform well in areas with high concentrations of these voters.\n\nOther candidates, including Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, and Rick Perry, are struggling to gain traction. Gingrich has seen a significant decline in the polls and is facing criticism for his past support of global warming legislation and his quasi-lobbying work for Freddie Mac. Bachmann's campaign has been marred by infighting and a lack of organization, while Perry's campaign has been plagued by gaffes and a lack of momentum.\n\nThe outcome of the Iowa caucuses will be closely watched, as it will set the tone for the rest of the primary season. A win for Romney would all but secure his nomination, while a loss could raise questions about his electability. A victory for Paul or Santorum would be a significant upset and could propel them to the forefront of the nomination process.\n\nIn terms of key counties to watch, Black Hawk County is expected to be a battleground, with a strong organized labor presence and a history of voting Democratic.

The study, conducted by researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University, analyzed data from over 21,000 pregnancies and found that women who consumed two to four servings of potatoes or chips per week had a 27% higher risk of developing gestational diabetes. Those who ate more than five portions of potatoes or chips per week had a 50% higher risk.\n\nThe researchers propose that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grains may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. They estimate that swapping two servings of potatoes per week for other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods could lower the risk by 9-12%.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Cuilin Zhang, suggests that women can reduce their risk of gestational diabetes by making simple swaps, such as switching from baked or mashed potatoes to sweet potatoes or boiled new potatoes, choosing whole grain bread instead of white bread, and swapping frozen microwaveable French fries for pasta or noodles.\n\nHowever, UK experts have cautioned that the study's findings are not conclusive and that more research is needed to confirm the association between potato consumption and gestational diabetes. They also note that potatoes are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and that women should not completely eliminate them from their diet.\n\nDr. Emily Burns, of Diabetes UK, said that the study does not prove that eating potatoes before pregnancy will increase a woman's risk of developing gestational diabetes, but it does highlight a potential association between the two. Dr. Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, said that the evidence suggests that women should eat more starchy foods, including potatoes, as part of a balanced diet.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has linked high-glycemic foods to a higher risk of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Dr. Aldo Palmieri of UCLA Santa Monica Hospital noted that potatoes are carbohydrates and can elevate blood sugar levels, but that moderation is key.\n\nThe study's limitations include a lack of diversity in the study population, with 90% of participants being white, and a generally healthy population of nurses.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

In other developments: Supplies from the US and other countries are arriving, but some areas are still in desperate need of relief and \"the major challenge is logistics,\" a European Commission spokesman tells the LA Times. \"With all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various Philippine authorities\u2014military, civilian structures, the Philippine Red Cross\u2014trying to distribute aid to so many communities ... obviously there are bottlenecks.\" Lawlessness in the devastated city of Tacloban is also slowing the distribution of aid, the Guardian finds. A Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men and there are rumors that inmates who escaped during the storm have been ambushing people carrying supplies. Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached. In Tacloban, where bodies are being trucked to mass graves, the city administrator says he is sticking by his original estimate of 10,000 dead in the city alone. In a smaller city south of Tacloban, the devastation is even worse and a 16-member medical team from California is laboring in extreme conditions to help survivors, NBC finds. The volunteer surgeons\u2014working by flashlight in Tanawan's ruined town hall\u2014believe the region will need help for months. \"I don\u2019t know when or how we are going to be able to leave,\" one doctor says. \"This is just the beginning of a wave of misery.\" USA Today has more on that front: The few doctors in Manila are already overwhelmed with hundreds of patients\u2014and those are mostly minor injuries. They're soon expecting to see big problems like pneumonia, diarrhea, infections, and dehydration.

They developed various contraptions and methods to preserve bodies, prevent mistakes in burial, and even create illusions of beheadings on stage. However, the science of death has come a long way since then. Recent studies have focused on understanding the unique chemical cocktail released by decomposing human bodies, which could potentially be used to train cadaver dogs and develop machines that can detect human remains.\n\n**The \"Smell of Death\"**\n\nResearchers have identified a unique five-chemical cocktail emitted by human corpses, which distinguishes them from other rotting animals. This cocktail consists of 3-methylbutyl pentanoate, 3-methylbutyl 3-methylbutyrate, 3-methylbutyl 2-methylbutyrate, butyl pentanoate, and propyl hexanoate. These esters are produced by degrading muscles, carbohydrates, and fat tissues.\n\n**Training Cadaver Dogs**\n\nThe discovery of this unique chemical cocktail could lead to the development of more efficient training methods for cadaver dogs. Currently, these dogs are trained using nonspecific compounds such as cadaverine and putrescine, which can lead to false positives. The new research suggests that a combination of eight compounds, including diethyl disulfide, methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide, and 3-methylthio-1-propanol, could be used to train cadaver dogs more specifically.\n\n**Portable Detection Devices**\n\nThe study also suggests that a portable device could be developed to detect human remains using the unique chemical cocktail. This device would be sensitive enough to locate human remains, which could be particularly useful in search and rescue operations.\n\n**Limitations and Future Research**\n\nWhile the study provides valuable insights into the science of death, there are limitations to the research. The use of glass jars and partial organs may not accurately represent the decomposition process in full bodies. Further investigation in the field with full bodies is necessary to confirm the results. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of considering environmental factors that can influence decomposition and the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe science of death has come a long way since the 19th century, and recent studies have made significant progress in understanding the unique chemical cocktail released by decomposing human bodies. The discovery of this", "answers": ["Thanks to a team of researchers from Belgium, we may be close to synthesizing and, yes, possibly even bottling and selling the smell of human death, Discovery reports. Eva Cuypers and her team at the University of Leuven separated the tissues and organs of six humans and 26 different animals, placing them in jars to decompose over the next six months. By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans. These five compounds\u2014called esters\u2014were created by decomposing muscles, carbohydrates, and fat, Discovery reports. The esters create a \"singular chemical cocktail\" in decomposing humans and could explain why so-called cadaver dogs are able to sniff out dead people amid any number of competing smells, including other dead animals, Science reports. Cuypers and her team published their findings last week. They believe the results could be used to better train cadaver dogs or even create a machine that could do the same job. And Discovery points out the synthetic smell of decomposing human bodies could prove popular at Halloween parties. Experts have questioned components of the research\u2014including the separation of tissue and organs\u2014and Cuypers plans a follow-up study using full bodies buried in a field, Science reports.

This ice loss has contributed to a global sea level rise of about 7.6 millimeters over the past quarter century. The study, conducted by an international team of ice experts, used 24 different methods to analyze ice loss, including satellite data, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations.\n\nThe researchers found that the ice sheet in West Antarctica, which accounts for most of the melting, is in a state of collapse. The study estimates that the continent has lost nearly 84 billion tons of ice per year from 1992 to 2011, and this rate increased to over 241 billion tons per year from 2012 to 2017. The team warns that if the current trend continues, Antarctica alone could contribute about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century.\n\nThe study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd, attributes the melting to warmer ocean waters, which are nibbling at the floating edges of ice sheets from below. The warming of the southern ocean is connected to shifting winds, which are linked to global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The team emphasizes that the forces driving these changes are not expected to improve in a warming climate.\n\nEast Antarctica, on the other hand, is losing relatively little ice, with an average annual loss of about 31 tons since 2012. However, scientists are not confident that this trend will continue, and it is likely due to natural variability rather than climate change.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research, which has shown that Antarctica's ice sheet is vulnerable to climate change.

The stone, which is dark brown with lighter brown swirls, was stored in a weathered leather pouch made by one of Joseph Smith's wives, Emma Smith. The church has also released a new book containing photos of the printer's manuscript of the Book of Mormon, which includes the stone.\n\nThe translation of the Book of Mormon is a miraculous event that has been shrouded in mystery. Joseph Smith, who had very little formal education, translated the book in just three months, from April to June 1829. The church has released a topic page on lds.org stating that God prepared additional, practical help in the form of physical instruments to aid in the translation process. These instruments included the Urim and Thummim, a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim, and a seer stone, a small oval stone that Joseph discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates.\n\nThe translation process was a collaborative effort involving Joseph Smith and several scribes, including Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, Emma Smith, and others. The original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, 28 percent of which has survived, includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript. The manuscript also includes grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English, suggesting that the base language of the translation was not English.\n\nThe church has also acknowledged the contributions of scholars to the historical content presented in the topic page, which highlights the miraculous events that led to the Book of Mormon's translation. The book has been translated into 110 different languages and has been distributed to over 168 million people since its publication in 1830. The church's efforts to increase transparency and shed light on its history are aimed at filling a void on the internet for accurate information and preventing current members from leaving the church.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has had a profound impact on the world, and its translation is a testament to the power of faith and the gift of God.

At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands.

The overcrowding and unstable weather conditions on the mountain have led to a series of tragic incidents, including the death of at least 16 Sherpas in an avalanche on April 18th. This is the worst climbing accident in the history of Everest, and it has sparked outrage and demands for better compensation and working conditions for the Sherpas.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the commercialization of climbing on Everest, with many expeditions prioritizing the interests of Western clients over the safety of the Sherpas. The Sherpas, who are paid relatively low wages and receive inadequate insurance benefits, are calling for better working conditions, higher compensation, and greater recognition for their role in supporting the climbing expeditions.\n\nThe Nepali government has been criticized for its response to the tragedy, with many Sherpas feeling that the offer of 40,000 rupees (approximately $400) to the families of the deceased is inadequate. The Sherpas are demanding a higher compensation package, including a permanent relief fund, increased insurance benefits, and a monument to memorialize the deceased.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the growing trend of Everest becoming a spectator sport, with many climbers and guides prioritizing the thrill of the climb over the risks involved. The use of social media and other communication technologies has made it easier for climbers to share their experiences and attract sponsors, but it has also created a culture of voyeurism and a lack of respect for the risks involved.\n\nThe statistics on the fatality rate of Sherpas on Everest are alarming, with a death rate 12 times higher than that of US military personnel in Iraq from 2003-2007.

The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route.

As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

The study, published in the journal PLoS One, found that people can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men by viewing their faces in photographs, but not women. The researchers used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape.\n\nThe study found that faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are longer, with a wider distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. On the other hand, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that these facial characteristics were only associated with perceived intelligence and not actual IQ scores. The study also found that the correlation between these facial traits and perceived attractiveness suggests that there is an intelligence stereotype. The researchers propose that this stereotype may be a cultural construct, rather than a reflection of actual intelligence.\n\nThe study also found that people who were perceived as more attractive were also perceived as more intelligent, but this link was stronger for women's faces than men's faces. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the fact that women are often judged based on their attractiveness, which can make it difficult to accurately assess their intelligence.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for our understanding of how we perceive intelligence and how it is associated with facial characteristics.

The study used a similar methodology to the first study and found that people were able to accurately estimate the intelligence of men based on their facial photographs, but not women.

The discovery was made by a team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology, led by Mike Brown, who is famously known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006.\n\nAccording to the researchers, Planet Nine is a gas giant that is thought to be almost as big as Neptune and orbits billions of miles beyond Neptune's path. The planet is believed to be 5,000 times more massive than Pluto and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes it 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete around the sun.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was made using mathematical and computer modeling, and the researchers anticipate that it will be detected via telescope within the next five years. However, the existence of the planet is still a topic of debate, with some scientists cautioning that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system.\n\nMike Brown, the lead researcher on the project, has stated that he is confident in the existence of Planet Nine and believes that it will be a game-changer for our understanding of the solar system. He has also stated that he has no regrets about his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet, saying that it was a necessary step for the good of science.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked renewed calls for Pluto to be reinstated as a planet, but Brown has argued that this is not a viable option. He believes that Pluto's status as a dwarf planet is more accurate and that it is an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Pluto's status has been ongoing since its demotion in 2006, with some scientists arguing that it should remain a planet due to its size, shape, and orbital characteristics. However, Brown has stated that he is sad about the way the debate has played out in the past decade, and hopes that the discovery of Planet Nine will help to shift the focus away from the debate and towards a more nuanced understanding of the solar system.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Planet Nine is a significant development in the field of astronomy and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the solar system.

The airstrikes, which hit four towns in Idlib and Aleppo provinces, have left residents searching for survivors amidst the rubble.\n\nThe economic toll of the war is also severe, with the country's economy heavily hurt by the conflict. Inflation has risen to at least 36 percent, and the currency has dropped around 50 percent, now trading at 75 pounds to the dollar on the black market. The government estimates economic losses at $34 billion, while the opposition puts the losses at nearly three times that amount.

The spacecraft, launched in 2006, has traveled over 3 billion miles to reach the dwarf planet, which was once considered the ninth planet in our solar system but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\n**New Discoveries and Insights**\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft has already delivered data that is \"a gift for the ages,\" according to principal investigator Alan Stern. The data reveals that Pluto is larger than previously thought, with a diameter of 1,473 miles, and its interior contains more ice than rock. The spacecraft has also detected nitrogen escaping from Pluto's atmosphere, which could be a sign of a more complex atmospheric structure than previously thought.\n\n**The Flyby**\n\nThe flyby is a complex operation that requires the spacecraft to fly through a \"keyhole\" in space, just 100km by 150km, and arrive at the location within a margin of 100 seconds. The spacecraft will take hundreds of observations of Pluto and its five moons, including Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. The first high-resolution images will be released on Wednesday afternoon, and the rest of the data will trickle in over the next 16 months.\n\n**The Mission**\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft is the fastest spacecraft ever launched, traveling at over 30,000 miles per hour. It will pass by Pluto in just three minutes, but the entire close encounter will last for hours. The spacecraft will continue sailing on into the Kuiper Belt, a vast, icy debris ring outside the orbit of Neptune, and may even study another icy world within the next five years.\n\n**Australian Tracking Station to Receive Close-Up Images**\n\nThe Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex in Australia will be the first place in the world to receive close-up images of Pluto, which will be relayed back to Earth on Wednesday.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

However, this success is not unique to Disney, as other major studios are also focusing on big-budget films that can generate significant revenue through merchandising, TV spin-offs, and theme park attractions.\n\nMeanwhile, independent filmmakers are facing challenges in securing funding for mid-budget films. The cost of marketing a movie can be as high as 50% of the production budget, making it difficult for studios to justify smaller investments. As a result, the number of mid-budget films has decreased, and many filmmakers are struggling to make a living.\n\nDirectors like John Waters, David Lynch, and Francis Ford Coppola have spoken out about the difficulties of securing funding for their projects. Waters has said that the film business has changed, and studios now want filmmakers to make movies for little to no money. Coppola has stated that studios are no longer interested in taking risks on unique and innovative films, instead opting for safe, proven formulas.\n\nThe shift towards big-budget films has led to a decrease in the number of studio films being released, while the number of independent films has increased. However, the indie scene is also facing challenges, with many filmmakers struggling to secure distribution and funding. The rise of streaming services has changed the way people consume movies, and many filmmakers are turning to television as a more viable option.\n\nDirectors like Steven Soderbergh, Cary Fukunaga, and Jill Soloway have found success in television, directing shows like The Knick, True Detective, and Transparent.

The new measurements indicate that the universe is expanding at a rate of 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which is 5-9% higher than the previously estimated rate. This discrepancy has sparked a new wave of interest in the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which make up 95% of the universe but do not emit light.\n\nThe study, led by Nobel laureate Adam Riess, used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The researchers used a new method to calculate the distances, which involved measuring the brightness of Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. The new measurements have a margin of error of just 2.4%, making them the most accurate ever.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. If the discrepancy holds up, it could mean that dark energy, a mysterious force thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, is more powerful than previously thought. Alternatively, it could suggest that Einstein's theory of general relativity is incomplete or inaccurate.\n\nOther possible explanations for the discrepancy include the presence of unknown subatomic particles, such as dark radiation, which could be pushing galaxies apart at an even faster rate. The study also raises the possibility that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to the presence of dark matter, which is thought to make up a significant portion of the universe's mass-energy budget.\n\nThe discovery has sparked a new era of research into the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Scientists are working to refine their understanding of these mysterious components, which are thought to play a crucial role in the universe's evolution. The study's findings have also sparked debate among scientists, with some arguing that the discrepancy could be due to a mistake in the measurements, while others believe that it could be a sign of a more fundamental problem with our understanding of the universe.\n\nThe study's results have been published in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal and are expected to be a major topic of discussion in the scientific community. The Hubble Space Telescope has been instrumental in making these discoveries possible, and scientists are continuing to use the telescope to refine their understanding of the universe's expansion rate.\n\nThe implications of the study's findings are far-reaching and have significant implications for our understanding of the universe.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number\u2014and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties\u2014then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor.

Researchers have proposed various theories, including suffocation, damage to the hull from arms fire, and a lucky shot from a stray bullet. \n\nA new study published in PLoS One suggests that the crew of the Hunley died instantly from the shockwave generated by their own torpedo. The study, led by biomechanist Rachel Lance, used a 1/6 scale model of the Hunley to test the effects of the blast wave on the crew. The results showed that the shockwave would have caused catastrophic injuries to the crew's soft tissues, especially their brains and lungs, and would have left no mark on the skeletal remains.\n\nLance's research involved constructing a scale model of the Hunley and subjecting it to pressurized air blasts and black powder explosions while monitoring the effects with sensors. She also analyzed the effects of energy blasts on the human respiratory system and pored through documents at the National Archives in Washington. The study found that the crew would have been exposed to a blast wave of sufficient magnitude to cause instant death, with the calculated chances of survival being less than 16% for each crew member.\n\nThe Hunley's crew had set off a 61.2 kg (135 lb) black powder torpedo at a distance less than 5 m (16 ft) off its bow, which caused a blast that likely flexed the ship hull and transmitted the blast wave to the crew compartment. The secondary wave transmitted inside the crew compartment was of sufficient magnitude to cause instant death.\n\nLance's findings have been met with skepticism by the Hunley Project team, who have been studying the sub for 17 years. However, her research has shed new light on the mystery of the Hunley's sinking and has provided valuable insights into human physiology and the effects of blast waves on the human body.\n\nIn a separate investigation, Lance had previously debunked the suffocation theory, which suggested that the crew ran out of oxygen and suffocated.

Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub.

According to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the 20th-century rise was likely faster than any of the previous 27 centuries, with a rate of 1.4 millimeters per year from 1900 to 2000.\n\nThe study, led by Bob Kopp of Rutgers University, used a global database of regional sea-level reconstructions to estimate that the 20th-century rise was likely between 3 and 7 centimeters, rather than the observed 14 centimeters. The researchers attributed the anomalous 20th-century rise to global warming, which they found would have resulted in a much smaller sea level rise of between 3 and 7 centimeters if humans had not been warming the planet.\n\nAnother study published in the same journal found that global sea levels rose faster in the past century than during the previous 27 centuries due to man-made global warming. The study, which compiled a database of geological sea-level indicators from marshes, coral atolls, and archaeological sites around the world, found that the seas rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000, a significant increase, especially for low-lying coastal areas.\n\nThe research also suggests that the current rate of sea level rise, at 3.4 millimeters per year, is still accelerating. The study's lead author, Robert Kopp, noted that the methods used to project these totals may not fully capture what happens over the course of this century, as the major contributors to sea level rise in the 21st century are expected to be the huge ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica.\n\nA separate study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that global sea level could increase by roughly one to four feet by 2100, depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases are released into the atmosphere in the coming decades.\n\nThe research also highlights the human fingerprints on coastal floods, with a study finding that thousands of U.S. coastal floods would not have occurred without human-caused global warming.

His book, \"Would You Stay?\", highlights the resilience of the people living in the area, who have learned to cope with the risks and uncertainties of living near the contaminated site.\n\nIn an effort to revitalize the area, the Ukrainian government has announced plans to develop solar power near the Chernobyl site. The project aims to utilize the area's cheap land and existing transmission facilities to generate renewable energy. The government has received expressions of interest from two U.S. investment firms and four Canadian energy companies, and Ukrainian developers plan to install a 4 MW project at the site by the end of the year.\n\nBelarus, Ukraine's northern neighbor, has also announced plans to develop a 22.3 MW solar power plant in the Brahin district, located near the Chernobyl site. The plant is expected to cover about 50% of the company's energy needs and pay itself off in four to five years.\n\nThe Chernobyl site remains a complex and challenging problem, with the 2,000-ton mass of radioactive material still present and the risk of further accidents or contamination. Ukrainian officials are counting on a sarcophagus to contain the site, but experts warn that this may not be enough to ensure safety for 3,000 years, the estimated time it will take for the site to be safe for human habitation. Detlef Appel, a geologist, suggests that truly safe radioactive waste storage needs to extend a million years into the future.\n\nThe legacy of the Chernobyl disaster continues to be felt, with many people still suffering from health problems related to radiation exposure.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "Iran has been in the spotlight for its human rights record, particularly when it comes to the treatment of children and juvenile offenders. According to a report by Amnesty International, Iran has continued to execute juvenile offenders, despite being one of the few countries that still practices this form of punishment. The report, titled \"Growing Up on Death Row: The Death Penalty and Juvenile Offenders in Iran,\" reveals that between 2005 and 2015, at least 73 juvenile offenders were executed, and currently, at least 160 are on death row.\n\nThe Iranian government has made some attempts to reform its laws, but these efforts have been deemed insufficient by human rights organizations. The 2013 Islamic Penal Code allows judges to assess a juvenile offender's mental maturity at the time of the offense and potentially impose an alternative punishment to the death penalty. However, this provision has not been consistently applied, and many juvenile offenders continue to face the death penalty.\n\nIran has also ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the use of the death penalty against people under the age of 18. However, the country has made a reservation to the convention, stating that it will not abide by the provisions that are incompatible with its domestic laws and Islamic standards.\n\nIn addition to the issue of juvenile offenders, Iran has also been criticized for its treatment of children in general. The country has a high rate of child poverty, and many children are forced to work in hazardous conditions. The government has also been accused of using child labor in the carpet industry.\n\nThe Iranian government has also been criticized for its handling of cases involving children who have committed crimes. In one case, a 17-year-old girl named Mahsa was accused of killing her father in a fit of anger. Her brothers are requesting the death penalty for her, which has sparked outrage among human rights organizations.\n\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Iran has ratified, sets out a range of rights for children, including the right to life, the right to education, and the right to protection from exploitation and abuse. The convention also prohibits the use of the death penalty against people under the age of 18.\n\nIn conclusion, Iran's human rights record, particularly when it comes to the treatment of children and juvenile offenders, is a major concern.

The bill, which has gained support from several Democratic senators, including potential 2020 presidential candidates, would establish a single-payer system similar to those in the UK, France, Australia, and Canada. Under the plan, the current Medicare safety net would be expanded to cover all Americans, and individuals would not have to purchase private insurance.\n\nThe bill has been met with mixed reactions from Democrats, with some, like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, declining to endorse it. However, several liberal senators, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker, have signed on as co-sponsors. The plan has also gained support from some progressive activists, who see it as a key step towards achieving universal health care.\n\nThe bill's financing is a major concern, with Sanders proposing a progressive tax system that would increase taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. However, the exact details of the plan's financing are still unclear, and some experts have raised concerns about the potential costs and feasibility of the plan.\n\nDespite these concerns, the idea of Medicare for All is gaining traction among the public, with a recent poll showing that 53% of Americans support a national health care plan.

The accusation was made by a Washington D.C. journalist, Andrea Pitzer, who compared passages from Dylan's lecture to SparkNotes' summary of Herman Melville's novel \"Moby-Dick.\" Pitzer found that 20 passages from SparkNotes' \"Moby-Dick\" notes show up in Dylan's Nobel lecture with similar wording. Dylan's lecture was recorded on June 4 and submitted to the Swedish Academy, which required him to give a lecture in order to receive the prize and the $920,000 that comes with it.\n\nThis is not the first time Dylan has been accused of lifting passages from other works. He has been accused of borrowing from various poets and novelists for his song lyrics, including Lead Belly and Henry Thomas, and has been accused of borrowing the melody for \"Blowin' in the Wind\" from a 16th-century Protestant hymn. Dylan has defended his use of other people's work, saying that it is a part of the folk tradition and that he is working within the rules and limitations of his art form.\n\nHowever, some critics argue that the use of SparkNotes in the Nobel lecture is different from the folk process. Alex Lubet, a University of Minnesota music professor, said that while the lecture is a post-modern work of art, he would be concerned if Dylan had turned in a classroom assignment using this approach. Cultural critic David Yaffe, a Syracuse University professor of humanities, does not see the alleged plagiarizing as detracting from the value of the lecture and believes that Dylan was simply taking a few shortcuts.\n\nDylan has also been accused of being a magpie, borrowing from various sources and not always giving credit. He has been open about his borrowings, even releasing an album titled \"Love and Theft\" in 2001, which was named after Eric Lott's book on racial appropriation. Dylan has also been accused of using SparkNotes in his songwriting, with some researchers pointing out that snippets of lyrics from his 2006 album \"Modern Times\" could be traced to the works of Ovid, Henry Timrod, and other poets.\n\nIn a 2012 Rolling Stone interview, Dylan defended his use of other people's work, saying that it is a part of the tradition and that he is working within the rules and limitations of his art form.

She says at least 20 of the 78 sentences involved strongly resemble SparkNotes passages and compares several of them side by side. Multiple phrases, including \"Ahab's lust for vengeance,\" appear both in SparkNotes and Dylan's talk, but not in Moby Dick itself. He had to give the talk to collect $922,000 in prize money. \"Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness,\" a quote that one blogger thought Dylan had invented, appears to be based on SparkNotes. Pitzer suggests that Dylan donate some of the prize money to the SparkNotes writer, though others are more forgiving.

The officer suspected the crash might've been intentional and the 27-year-old spent a night at a mental health facility in Frisco. A day later, the Breckenridge man was released and disappeared, reports the Washington Post. His family told the Summit Daily News McAtee had 10 days earlier stopped taking his medication for bipolar disorder, just as he had done a few times before when he dropped out of sight, but he always resurfaced. Over the next year, they scoured the country in search of him, thinking perhaps he'd gone off the grid like Chris McCandless, the subject of his favorite book, Into the Wild. They reached out to contacts in Alaska, where McAtee had flown planes, and homeless shelters, where they thought he might volunteer, but found no sign of him. In July, McAtee's father wrote online that \"there is a 50% chance that Jack wandered off into the wilderness and attempted to survive.\" But a month later, two hikers found a skull near the top of the Peak One, immediately south of Frisco; DNA confirmation that the skull was McAtee's came earlier this month. \"Our search has come to fruition,\" McAtee's family wrote. \"Our closure is at hand, albeit we acknowledge it will be a lifelong process.\" It's still not clear how or when McAtee died. His skull was all that was found of his remains, reports the Denver Post. What is certain: \"A person, an irreplaceable person, is gone,\" his family says.

In 2014, the city switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which led to the contamination of the water with lead. The lead contamination caused permanent brain damage in children and was linked to other health and behavior problems.\n\nIn addition to the lead contamination, there was a spike in cases of Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County, where Flint is located. From June 2014 to November 2015, there were 87 cases of Legionnaires' disease, with 10 fatalities. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) reported that the number of cases was a jump from previous years, when the county saw between 6 and 13 cases.\n\nWhile state officials said they couldn't make a connection between the water and the spike in disease, a drinking water expert, Marc Edwards, said the rise in cases was \"dramatic\" and that there was a \"very strong likelihood\" the river's water played a role. Edwards suggested that the lack of corrosion control in the water treatment plant and the presence of older plumbing systems in large buildings may have contributed to the outbreak.\n\nThe MDHHS began interviewing residents who were affected in April 2015, and Edwards and his team noticed high levels of the bacteria that can cause the illness in some large buildings. The state has not changed its recommendations for bathing or showering, and Edwards noted that the water is safe for residents to shower in.\n\nGovernor Rick Snyder acknowledged that the increase in Legionnaires' disease \"just adds to the disaster we are already facing\" and welcomed a federal investigation into the crisis.

And while the MDHHS isn't able to definitively tie the spike to Flint's water, it's taking the news seriously, and a drinking water expert who's been studying Flint's water tells the Free Press there's a \"very strong likelihood\" that it played a role. MDHHS officials first observed the rise in Legionnaires' cases in the fall of 2014, per the Free Press, and researchers found the bacteria to blame was proliferating in larger buildings, many with older plumbing. \"Our hypothesis is that something about the Flint River and lack of corrosion control, plus big buildings, is creating these problems,\" Marc Edwards, head of an independent Virginia team looking into the crisis, tells the Free Press.

In Pennsylvania, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver during a fatal accident can be held liable for the accident, setting a precedent that third-party texters can be held accountable if they are aware the driver is texting and will view the text while on the road. This decision follows a 2013 New Jersey appellate ruling that established the same cause of action against third parties in motor vehicle accident litigation.\n\nIn New Jersey, a court ruled that a person sending a text message to a driver can be liable if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and be distracted. The court emphasized that the sender's liability is not automatic and requires additional proofs, such as evidence that the sender knew or had special reason to know that the driver would read the message while driving.\n\nThe Pennsylvania ruling and the New Jersey court decision have significant implications for the liability of those who contribute to distracted driving. If the sender of a text message is aware that the recipient is driving and will view the text while on the road, they may be held liable for any accidents that result from the driver's distraction. This could lead to a shift in the way people view distracted driving, making it less socially acceptable and potentially reducing the number of accidents caused by texting and driving.\n\nLegislative developments are also underway to crack down on distracted driving. In New York, lawmakers have proposed a \"textalyzer\" bill that would allow police officers to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that is not in accordance with state laws. The bill also proposes that drivers would be forced to hand over their phone after a wreck or risk a driver's license suspension.\n\nThe textalyzer bill and the Pennsylvania ruling are part of a growing trend to hold individuals and companies accountable for their role in contributing to distracted driving.

For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin \u2026 an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ... These legal developments could signal that a similar change in thinking is underway regarding distracted driving.\" (Jenny McCarthy's son called the cops for her texting-while-driving transgression.)"], "length": 10869}

According to the report, the CEOs of America's top 350 companies earned 312 times more than their workers on average last year. This pay gap has been increasing dramatically since the 1990s, with some fluctuations. In 1965, the ratio of CEO to worker pay was 20 to one, which rose to 58 to one by 1989 and peaked in 2000 at 344 times the wage of their average worker.\n\nThe report also notes that CEO pay has been rising rapidly since 2009, with some CEOs earning millions of dollars in compensation. For example, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook earned $21.7 million in 2017, while the average McDonald's worker earned just $7,017. Similarly, Walmart's CEO Doug McMillon earned $22.8 million in 2017, while the average Walmart worker earned $19,177.\n\nThe EPI report attributes the rise in CEO compensation to stock-related components, such as stock awards and realized stock options. In 2017, these components accounted for nearly all of the growth in CEO compensation, with the value of exercised stock options growing by 47.1 percent. The report also notes that the pay gap between CEOs and workers has been fueled by the growth of top 1 percent incomes, which has been driven by households headed by nonfinancial-sector executives and financial-sector workers.\n\nThe report concludes that the escalation of CEO compensation has had a direct impact on people down the corporate ladder, with the redistribution of wages to the top 1 percent affecting the wage growth of the bottom 90 percent. The authors argue that implementing higher marginal income tax rates at the very top, setting corporate tax rates higher for firms with higher CEO-to-worker compensation ratios, and changing corporate governance practices, such as greater use of \"say on pay,\" could help to reverse the trend of excessive executive pay and broaden wage growth.\n\nThe report also notes that the pay gap between CEOs and workers is not unique to the United States, but is a global phenomenon. According to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the average CEO-to-worker compensation ratio in the OECD countries is 121 to one, with the United States having one of the highest ratios.\n\nOverall, the EPI report highlights the need for policymakers to address the growing pay gap between CEOs and workers, which has significant implications for economic inequality and", "answers": ["For every dollar made by the average Facebook employee, Mark Zuckerberg earned $37 in 2017.

Despite his best efforts to control his addiction, he lost over $4 million and eventually took his own life.\n\nStevens' story is not unique. According to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, 1.1 to 1.6 percent of the adult population in the United States has a gambling disorder, which translates to approximately 3 million to 4 million Americans. The industry has been accused of designing slot machines to be addictive, with features such as virtual reel mapping, near misses, and losses disguised as wins.\n\n**The Business Plan for Casinos**\n\nCasinos have developed a business plan that relies on addicted gamblers.

The industry has developed formulas to calculate the \"predicted lifetime value\" of individual gamblers, with the biggest losers referred to as \"whales.\"\n\n**The Science Behind Addiction**\n\nResearch has shown that slot machines can activate the brain's reward system, releasing dopamine and creating a feeling of pleasure.

However, a recent study has found that older fathers may also have a unique advantage: their sons are more likely to be \"geekier\" and have higher IQs.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers at King's College London, analyzed data from over 15,000 twins and found that sons of older fathers scored higher on the \"Geek Index,\" a measure of non-verbal IQ, focus, and social aloofness. The researchers also found that the older the father, the higher the score.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Magdalena Janecka, suggests that the link between older fathers and geekier sons may be due to the fact that older men are more likely to have higher levels of \"geekiness\" themselves. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of 'geekiness,'\" she said.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate about the potential benefits of older fatherhood. While some experts warn that the risks associated with older fatherhood, such as increased risk of autism and schizophrenia, outweigh any potential benefits, others see the trend towards delayed parenthood as a positive development.\n\nProf. Allan Pacey, from the University of Sheffield, notes that while the idea of a \"geek gene\" is intriguing, it's not a reason to delay starting a family. \"The dangers of older parenting are well described, such as an increased risk of infertility, miscarriage, or conceiving a child with a variety of debilitating disorders,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Dr. Janecka suggests that the study's findings could have a positive impact on society. \"Perhaps we are destined for a future society of geniuses that are going to help us solve all the world's problems,\" she said.\n\nThe study's findings also raise questions about the potential link between geekiness and autism.

The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry.

The result means May can stay on as party leader for another 12 months, but her position remains precarious.\n\nMay's Brexit deal, which was negotiated with the European Union, has been met with opposition from both pro-Brexit and pro-EU factions within her party. The deal, which aims to maintain close ties with the EU, has been criticized for its \"backstop\" clause, which would keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely. May has promised to step down before the 2022 election, but her critics argue that she should resign immediately.\n\nThe no-confidence vote has not changed the fundamental dynamics of the Brexit debate, with May still facing opposition from both within her party and from the EU. The European Union has made it clear that the withdrawal agreement, which includes the backstop clause, is not up for renegotiation. May's critics argue that she will not be able to secure the necessary changes to the deal, and that a new leader would be able to renegotiate a better deal with the EU.\n\nThe outcome of the vote has been met with a mixed reaction from business leaders, with some expressing alarm at the ongoing uncertainty and others welcoming the stability that May's survival brings. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has reiterated the EU's commitment to an orderly British withdrawal, but warned that time is running out.\n\nThe Brexit process is now set to continue, with May facing a vote on her deal in the House of Commons before January 21. If she loses, she will be replaced as party leader, and a new leader will be chosen to take over. The new leader will then be expected to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU, which could lead to a further extension of the Brexit deadline.\n\nIn the meantime, the UK's economy is facing uncertainty, with businesses expressing concern about the impact of the ongoing Brexit crisis.

The most violent period was between midnight and 3 a.m. on Sunday, when 30 people were shot, including five mass shootings that injured 25 people.\n\nAccording to Chicago Police Chief of Patrol Fred Waller, the violence is largely attributed to gang conflicts and retaliatory attacks. Waller stated that the police department is focusing its resources on neighborhoods where retaliation is likely, and that the department is working to target illegal guns and gang members.\n\nThe shootings occurred in various locations across the city, including block parties, funerals, and gatherings.

Monis, who had a history of violent crime and extremist views, had been on bail for multiple charges, including being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife and over 50 sexual and indecent assault charges.\n\nMonis, who had sought asylum in Australia in 1996, had a long history of radicalization, which was fueled by his grievances against the Australian government and increasing marginalization. He had been known to the Australian police and had been convicted of sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. He had also been involved in a long-running legal battle to overturn his conviction, which was ultimately dismissed by the High Court.\n\nThe siege began on Monday morning when Monis, armed with a gun, took 17 hostages at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place, Sydney. Police negotiated with Monis for 16 hours before storming the cafe, resulting in the deaths of two hostages, cafe manager Tori Johnson and lawyer Katrina Dawson, and the gunman himself.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has questioned why Monis was not on the country's terror watch list, given his long history of violent crime and extremist views. An investigation has been launched into the police operation and the motives of Monis, who had claimed to be a spiritual healer and had posted extremist material online.\n\nMonis' former lawyer, Manny Conditsis, described him as an isolated figure who had acted alone and had nothing to lose, given his multiple charges and alleged mistreatment in prison. Conditsis also stated that Monis' ideology was so strong that it clouded his judgment and led him to participate in the siege.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the effectiveness of Australia's terror watch list and the prioritization of suspects. The Australian National Imams Council has issued a statement condemning the tragedy and offering condolences to the families of the victims.\n\nThe aftermath of the siege has seen a major police presence deployed in the heart of Sydney, with hundreds of bouquets laid in memory of the victims at the scene.

The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell.

The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "length": 4410}

The BFG, directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the Roald Dahl novel, earned $24 million on a $140 million budget, making it a commercial failure. The movie's poor performance can be attributed to several factors, including its confusing title, lack of recognizable faces, and failure to appeal to both children and adults. The film's visual effects were praised, but it failed to deliver a compelling story and emotional depth.\n\nThe BFG's box office performance was disappointing, especially considering its high production budget. The movie's domestic total is expected to be around $55-$65 million, with its success relying heavily on overseas figures. This would make it the first unmitigated Steven Spielberg box office bomb that was intended as a commercial crowd-pleaser.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to The BFG's poor performance, including its confusing title, lack of recognizable faces, and failure to appeal to both children and adults. The film's marketing strategy was also criticized for being too low-key, lacking the brand-name bombast that is currently in vogue. Additionally, the movie's release date may have been poorly timed, as it was sandwiched between the success of Finding Dory and other big-budget releases.\n\nThe BFG's failure is a rare misstep for Spielberg, who has a long history of making successful films.

Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d"], "length": 4655}

He began playing the ukulele and later the banjo, and his love for folk music led him to drop out of Harvard University to travel the country, learning and collecting songs from ordinary people. He met Woody Guthrie, a fellow folk singer, and together they formed the Almanac Singers, a group that sang union songs and anti-war songs.\n\nSeeger's music career took off in the 1940s with the formation of the Weavers, a group that included Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman. They had a string of hits, including \"Goodnight, Irene\" and \"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine,\" but their success was short-lived due to Seeger's association with the Communist Party. He was blacklisted by the US government and denied broadcast exposure, but he continued to tour college campuses and perform at benefit concerts.\n\nSeeger's activism and protest songs made him a target of the Un-American Activities Committee, and he was charged with contempt of Congress.

The women, who are often desperate for money, are lured into this work by the promise of a few dollars a day, but are subjected to harassment and abuse by their clients.\n\nAccording to a report by the Washington Post, one woman, Suh, was forced to resort to online sex work after her husband's construction earnings were not enough to support their family. She was paid $3 on her first day and $120 in her best week, but eventually decided to leave the work after feeling \"disgusting\" and wanting to be a good mother to her daughters.\n\nSuh's story is not unique. Many North Korean women are sold to Chinese husbands or trafficked into prostitution, where they are forced to work in brothels or through online sex sites. The Chinese government has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent human trafficking and protect North Korean women from exploitation.\n\nA group of female North Korean workers was recently repatriated from China after it was discovered that they had been forced to work as prostitutes at a food factory. The women had been placed under strict living conditions and were barred from traveling outside their lodging alone, but were still able to engage in illegal activities, including prostitution.\n\nThe situation is made worse by the fact that many North Korean women are not allowed to leave their homes or communicate with locals, making it difficult for them to seek help or escape their situation. The Chinese government's treatment of North Korean refugees has also been criticized, with the State Department's 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report noting that the government does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.\n\nDespite the risks, some North Korean women are trying to escape their situation and seek a better life.

Purchasing North Korean women is big business in China for men who can't find wives any other way: The asking price for women between 15 and 25 can near $12,000. Life in China is impoverished and dangerous for these North Korean nationals: They can be deported back to their home country if they're caught, per Radio Free Asia.

The unmasking, which was done on dozens of occasions, allowed for the names of Trump officials to be sent to top officials, including those at the National Security Council, the Defense Department, and the CIA. The names were part of incidental surveillance of candidate and President-elect Trump and people close to him, including family members, for up to a year before he took office.\n\nAccording to sources, Rice's requests were made to understand why the Trump officials were appearing in intelligence reports, and she did not spread the information. However, the unmasking of the names was highly unusual and has raised concerns about the potential abuse of power.\n\nThe news has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that Rice's actions were within the law, while others see it as a clear example of politicized surveillance. The White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, has called out the media for not covering the story, while the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, has been criticized for not raising concerns about the unmasking itself.\n\nThe story has also raised questions about the Obama administration's handling of surveillance and the potential for abuse of power. The Senate and House intelligence committees are now investigating the matter, and Rice has been asked to testify under oath.\n\nThe news has also highlighted the contrast between the media's coverage of the story and the lack of attention given to the Trump-Russia connection. While the media has been quick to jump on the Trump-Russia story, they have largely ignored the potential abuse of power by the Obama administration.\n\nIn related news, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has been criticized for publicly revealing information about the unmasking without disclosing names, but it has now been revealed that he was onto something. Nunes had to go to the White House to verify his information because the records containing Rice's unmasking request are held at the National Security Council.\n\nThe story has also raised questions about the role of civil libertarians in holding the government accountable for its actions. While some civil libertarians have been vocal about the potential for abuse of power, others have been silent on the issue.\n\nOverall, the story has sparked a heated debate about the potential for abuse of power and the need for greater transparency and accountability in government.", "answers": ["Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice is back in the news again, this time regarding President Trump's wiretapping allegations.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed\u2014she didn't respond to the story\u2014but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president\u2019s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies.\""], "length": 4159}

The creditors, which include the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, have warned that a \"No\" vote could lead to Greece's exit from the eurozone.\n\nThe crisis began in 2010 when Greece's debt burden became unsustainable, and the country was forced to seek a bailout. The bailout came with conditions, including austerity measures and reforms, which were intended to help Greece reduce its debt and improve its economy. However, the measures have been unpopular with the Greek people, and the country's economy has continued to struggle.\n\nTsipras' government has been negotiating with the creditors for a new bailout deal, but the talks have been unsuccessful. The government has proposed a number of changes to the original deal, including a 30% \"haircut\" on the country's debt and a 20-year grace period for the remaining debt. However, the creditors have rejected these proposals, and the government has called for a referendum to give citizens a say in the matter.\n\nThe referendum question is complex and has been criticized for being unclear. Voters are being asked to approve or reject a proposal that includes two parts: \"reforms for the completion of the current program and beyond\" and a \"Preliminary debt sustainability analysis.\" The outcome of the vote is uncertain, with polls showing a dead heat between the \"Yes\" and \"No\" camps.\n\nThe consequences of a \"No\" vote are severe, with the country's economy likely to suffer significantly. The banks have been closed, and there are limits on cash withdrawals, making it difficult for people to access their money. The country's creditors have also warned that a \"No\" vote could lead to Greece's exit from the eurozone, which would have significant economic and social implications.\n\nOn the other hand, a \"Yes\" vote would likely lead to a caretaker government and a continuation of the austerity measures that have been imposed on the country.

The comment sparked outrage, particularly in a state with a history of racist violence and lynchings. Hyde-Smith initially refused to apologize, but later said she was sorry \"for anyone that was offended.\" She also faced criticism for her history of promoting Confederate symbols and her attendance at a private high school that was established to avoid integration.\n\nDespite the controversy, Hyde-Smith was heavily favored to win, and President Donald Trump visited the state twice to campaign for her. Trump's visits were seen as an attempt to rally the Republican base and boost turnout.

The practice was based on a revelation from God, which stated that marriage could last beyond death and that eternal marriage was essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children. The revelation, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, was given to Joseph Smith in 1831, and it taught that marriage could be sealed for time and eternity, linking loved ones together for all eternity.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not widely accepted by early members of the Church, and it was met with controversy and opposition. However, many members eventually came to accept the practice after experiencing powerful spiritual experiences and receiving guidance from Church leaders. The practice was introduced incrementally, with participants being asked to keep their involvement confidential.\n\nIn Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith married multiple wives and authorized other members to practice plural marriage. The practice spread slowly, and by the time the Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, at least 196 men and 521 women had entered into plural marriages. Participants in these early plural marriages pledged to keep their involvement confidential, although they anticipated a time when the practice would be publicly acknowledged.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not without its challenges, and it was difficult for all involved. Joseph Smith's wife, Emma, struggled with the practice, and Joseph himself was placed in an agonizing dilemma when Emma opposed plural marriage. He may have thought that her rejection of the practice exempted him from the law of Sarah, which required a wife's consent before her husband could enter into plural marriage.\n\nDespite the challenges, many members of the Church saw plural marriage as a redemptive process of sacrifice and spiritual refinement. They believed that the practice would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith, but it would also be one of the greatest blessings. Many members, including Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball, reported experiencing spiritual witnesses that helped them accept the practice.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was eventually discontinued in 1890, when Church President Wilford Woodruff issued the Manifesto, which stated that the Church would no longer practice plural marriage.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

Researchers from the University of New South Wales and Miami University conducted an experiment using the video game Halo 3, where they observed how male players treated female players. The study found that men who were less skilled at the game and performed poorly were more likely to make nasty comments to female players, while high-skilled players were more likely to be nice to them.\n\nThe researchers argue that this behavior is an attempt by low-status males to maintain their social status and dominance in a male-dominated environment. According to evolutionary theory, men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, and the introduction of a female competitor can threaten their position in the hierarchy. As a result, low-status males may become hostile towards female players to suppress their disturbance on the hierarchy and retain their social rank.\n\nThe study also found that high-skilled males, on the other hand, were more positive towards female players, suggesting that they were switching to a supportive and potentially mate-attracting role. The researchers suggest that this behavior is an attempt to increase their attractiveness to women, who are attracted to dominance.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for understanding online harassment and sexism, particularly in male-dominated environments such as online gaming communities. The researchers argue that teaching young males that losing to the opposite sex is not socially debilitating may be a way to counter sexist attitudes and behaviors.\n\nThe study's results are supported by a previous study published in the journal PLOS One in 2015, which also found that low-status males were more likely to be hostile towards female players in an online game. The study's authors argue that video games offer a unique opportunity to examine variation in sexist behaviors and the situations that result in changes in sexist attitudes.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of considering an evolutionary perspective when exploring the factors that affect male hostility towards women.

According to a letter from the inspector general for the intelligence community, some of the emails sent from Clinton's private server contained classified information, but it was not identified as such at the time. The IG reviewed a \"limited sampling\" of her emails and found that four contained classified information. Clinton has denied sending classified information from her personal server, but the controversy has sparked a renewed investigation by the Justice Department.\n\n**Classification of Information**\n\nIn a related development, President Barack Obama issued an executive order in 2009 outlining the classification of national security information. The order establishes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information. It also sets out the criteria for original classification, including the need for an original classification authority to determine that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security.\n\n**Access to Classified Information**\n\nThe executive order also sets out the criteria for access to classified information, including the need for a need-to-know determination and the requirement that individuals be granted access only to the specific information they need to perform their duties. The order also establishes the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, which is responsible for reviewing appeals of classification decisions.\n\n**Implementation and Review**\n\nThe executive order requires agencies to establish programs for the classification, safeguarding, and declassification of national security information. It also requires agencies to provide training and education to personnel on the proper handling and classification of classified information. The order also establishes the Information Security Oversight Office, which is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the order and ensuring compliance with its provisions.\n\n**Sanctions**\n\nThe executive order establishes sanctions for individuals who knowingly, willfully, or negligently disclose classified information or who fail to properly classify or safeguard classified information. Sanctions may include reprimand, suspension without pay, removal, termination of classification authority, loss or denial of access to classified information, or other sanctions in accordance with applicable law and agency regulation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State continues to unfold, with renewed investigation by the Justice Department.

Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Center and American University have found that mustached bats, like humans, use the left and right sides of their brains to process different aspects of sounds. The left brain is better at processing fast sounds, while the right brain processes slow ones.\n\nThis finding is significant because it challenges the notion that only humans use different sides of their brains to distinguish different aspects of sound. The study, published in Frontiers of Neuroscience, opens a pathway to studying bat brains in order to understand certain human language disorders and potentially even improving computer speech recognition.\n\nThe researchers found that the slower timing of the right hemisphere may allow us to identify who is speaking, gauge their emotional state via tone-of-voice, and tease out pitch in music. In mustached bats, the need for hemispheric specialization is even more compelling, as they need to use the fast timing of the left hemisphere to distinguish communication sounds from each other, and the slow timing of the right hemisphere to use sonar to track the velocity of fast-moving insects.\n\nThe study also found that this asymmetric sound processing is sex-dependent, with males having more asymmetry than females. This is consistent with humans, where women tend to use both the left and right hemispheres for language, but men largely use just the left hemisphere.\n\nThe researchers believe that this understanding of bat sound processing may spur research to confirm that assumption in humans. Additionally, this new understanding may make in-depth scientific studies of certain communication disorders, such as aphasia, nearly impossible.\n\n**Parnell's Mustached Bat**\n\nParnell's mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii) is a species of bat native to North, South, and Central America.

The search for Nakamoto has been ongoing, with several false leads and investigations by media outlets. Recently, two news outlets, Wired and Gizmodo, have identified Craig Steven Wright, an Australian computer expert and entrepreneur, as a likely creator of Bitcoin.\n\nWired reported that Wright's blog posts, leaked documents, and emails point to a connection between Wright and Nakamoto. The evidence includes a post on Wright's blog in August 2008, mentioning his intention to release a \"cryptocurrency paper,\" and a post in November 2008, requesting that readers encrypt their messages to him using a PGP public key linked to Nakamoto. Additionally, a leaked email from Wright to his lawyer in June 2008 references a paper called \"Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party\" that Wright expects to release in 2009.\n\nGizmodo also reported that Wright and Dave Kleiman, an American who died in 2013, were involved in the development of Bitcoin. A transcript of a 2014 meeting between Wright, lawyers, and tax officials quotes Wright as saying, \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009.\" Wright's statements and actions have raised suspicions that he may be Nakamoto.\n\nHowever, some have questioned the authenticity of the evidence, suggesting that it could be an elaborate hoax. Wright has a talent for obfuscation and has demonstrated a love of privacy, which has allowed him to avoid raising suspicions among bitcoin enthusiasts.

While scientists agree that climate change did not cause the storm, they note that warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the future.\n\n**Funding the Recovery**\n\nThe cost of recovery from the storm is expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars, and the issue of funding will test the nation's unity. In the past, Congress has faced partisan divides over funding for natural disasters, with some lawmakers demanding offsetting cuts in other programs. This approach has been criticized for undermining the core idea that government exists to help share risks that individuals and communities cannot reasonably bear alone.\n\n**Climate Change and Extreme Weather**\n\nClimate change is increasing the odds that storms will be more powerful and destructive. Scientists note that warmer oceans and air hold more moisture, leading to more intense precipitation events. While it is difficult to attribute any individual storm to climate change, the dominant scientific consensus is that climate change is a major factor in the increasing severity of disasters like Hurricane Harvey.\n\n**The Politics of Climate Change**\n\nThe discussion of climate change has been politicized, with some politicians and media outlets downplaying its role in the storm. Fox News, in particular, has been criticized for its coverage, with hosts accusing CNN of using the storm to advance a \"leftist agenda.\" However, experts note that climate change is a scientifically accepted fact, and its impact on extreme weather events is well-documented.\n\n**Adapting to Climate Change**\n\nAs the world grapples with the consequences of climate change, the issue of adaptation has become increasingly important. While adaptation can help communities prepare for and respond to extreme weather events, it is not a substitute for mitigation. Without radical reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation will become increasingly difficult and expensive, and may ultimately involve abandoning some communities to their fate.\n\n**The Future of Climate Change**\n\nThe future of climate change is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the world will be a very different place in the coming decades. Rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events will have far-reaching consequences for human societies and ecosystems. It is essential that we take action now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the changing climate.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Climate change did not cause Hurricane Harvey, but it may have intensified its impact.\n* Warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change\u2014particularly when talking about a single weather event\u2014the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

Dylan Farrow, now 28, has accused her father of molesting her when she was seven years old, a claim that has been denied by Woody Allen and supported by her brother Moses, 36. Moses, who is estranged from their mother Mia Farrow and many of his siblings, has come out in support of Woody Allen, stating that their mother coached Dylan to make the allegations against their father.\n\nMoses claims that their mother, Mia Farrow, created an atmosphere of fear and hate towards Woody Allen, and that Dylan's memories of the alleged abuse may be false. He also accuses their mother of bullying him as a child and of misleading the public about the happy household they had. Dylan, however, insists that her memories are true and that her mother never coached her to make false accusations.\n\nThe controversy began in 1992, when Mia Farrow accused Woody Allen of molesting their seven-year-old daughter Dylan during a custody battle over their three children. Woody Allen was investigated but not charged with molestation, and he has consistently denied the allegations. The case was highly publicized, and both sides of the family have been affected by it.\n\nIn a recent open letter to The New York Times, Dylan Farrow detailed her allegations against her father, reigniting the controversy. Her brother Moses has now spoken out in support of Woody Allen, accusing their mother of poisoning the children against their father. Woody Allen's family has also spoken out, with his sister Letty Aronson stating that he feels badly for Dylan, who has been \"poisoned\" by her mother.\n\nThe case has raised questions about the reliability of memories and the impact of family dynamics on children. While Dylan insists that her memories are true, Moses believes that their mother coached her to make false accusations. The controversy has also highlighted the complexities of family relationships and the challenges of navigating complex and sensitive issues.\n\nRobert B. Weide, a documentary filmmaker who has worked with Woody Allen, has also weighed in on the controversy. He has stated that he believes Woody Allen is innocent and that Dylan's allegations may be false. Weide has also pointed out that the investigative team that looked into the allegations found that Dylan's statements were likely coached or influenced by her mother.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of the media in perpetuating the allegations against Woody Allen.

She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him.\" He goes on to say that on the day in question, everyone who was in the house was in public, and neither Woody nor Dylan ever went off privately. \"I don\u2019t know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother,\" Moses says, claiming that Mia Farrow often hit him when he was a child and went into rages if she was not obeyed. Moses is now estranged from his mother and many of his siblings, but is close to Allen and his wife, Moses' adopted half-sister Soon-Yi Previn. Moses calls the whole fiasco Mia's \"vengeful way to pay [Allen] back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.\" In a piece written last month, Allen documentarian Robert B. Weide noted that while Moses, 15 at the time Dylan accused Allen, initially refused contact with his father, he recently told Weide he's now \"finally seeing the reality\" of what happened and used the term \"brainwashing.\" Dylan was quick to respond to her brother's public change of heart: She tells People, \"My brother is dead to me,\" adding, \"My mother never coached me. She never planted false memories in my brain. My memories are mine. I remember them.\" She also denies her mother hit anyone.

Despite this, none of these players have faced any sanctions, and many of them will be competing in the Australian Open.\n\nThe investigation found that these players have been involved in a network of match-fixing orchestrated by gambling syndicates in Russia and Italy, which have made hundreds of thousands of pounds betting on matches.

However, the attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, and the government was able to regain control.\n\n**The Coup Attempt**\n\nThe coup began with a group of soldiers taking control of key locations, including the parliament building in Ankara and the headquarters of the Turkish intelligence agency. The military also took control of state television, announcing a countrywide curfew and martial law. However, the government was able to rally its supporters, and thousands of people took to the streets to protest against the coup.\n\n**Government Response**\n\nPresident Erdogan, who was on vacation at the time, returned to Istanbul and addressed the nation via a video call, urging people to take to the streets to support the government.

However, a recent investigation by Politico has revealed that the deal was even more one-sided than initially thought. The seven men released by the US were not just \"civilians\" as portrayed by the Obama administration, but were actually accused of posing threats to national security, including being part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with US-made microelectronics for surface-to-air and cruise missiles.\n\nThe investigation found that the US dropped charges and international arrest warrants against 14 other men, all of whom were fugitives, and even dropped a demand for $10 million that a jury said an aerospace engineer illegally received from Tehran. The administration also removed Interpol red notices and dismissed charges against 14 Iranians for whom extradition requests were unlikely to be successful.\n\nOne of the prisoners released was Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who was central to Iran's pursuit of Western nuclear technology and had been charged with being part of a conspiracy to procure thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran via China. Another prisoner, Amin Ravan, was charged with smuggling US military antennas to Hong Kong and Singapore for use in Iran, and was also part of a procurement network providing Iran with high-tech components for IEDs that killed US military personnel in Iraq.\n\nThe investigation also found that the Obama administration had been slow-walking investigations into Iranian procurement networks operating in the US, and had even derailed its own National Counterproliferation Initiative, which was making progress in thwarting Iran's proliferation networks. The administration had also denied or delayed requests from prosecutors and agents to lure Iranian fugitives to friendly countries for arrest, and had slowed down efforts to extradite suspects already in custody overseas.\n\nThe investigation suggests that the Obama administration made a shrewd political calculation in focusing public attention on just the seven men it was freeing, and portraying them as mere sanctions violators.

But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

Using a brain-reading device that detects patterns in brain activity, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were able to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions, and even express their happiness with life.\n\nThe study, led by neuroscientist Niels Birbaumer, involved four patients, aged 24 to 76, who were trained to use the system over a year after they were diagnosed with completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS). The device uses infrared light to spot variations in blood flow in different regions of the brain, and a computer learns to distinguish the blood flow patterns for \"yes\" and \"no\" in each patient.\n\nThe patients were asked simple questions, such as \"Your husband's name is Joachim\" and \"Berlin is the capital of France,\" and were able to answer with a high degree of accuracy. When they scored at least 70% on the training questions, the doctors moved on to more personal questions, including those about quality of life. To the surprise of the researchers, all four patients indicated that they were \"happy\" with life, suggesting that locked-in syndrome might not be the living hell many presume it to be.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the treatment and care of patients with CLIS. While the condition is often associated with a poor quality of life, the patients in this study reported a good quality of life, even matching that of healthy people of the same age. The reasons for this are unclear, but Birbaumer suggests that patients may become focused on the good social interactions around them, and even experience a state of meditation due to their inability to feel or move their bodies.\n\nThe researchers are now working on building a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. This could potentially enable patients to express their thoughts and feelings in a more meaningful way, and could have a significant impact on their quality of life.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked interest in the potential use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to communicate with other kinds of brain-injured patients, including those who are presumed to be in a vegetative state. If replicated in a larger group of patients, the findings suggest that fNIRS may be a reliable means of communication for these patients.\n\nOverall, the study's breakthrough has the potential to transform the lives of patients with CLIS", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system.

Researchers at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. \u201cIt\u2019s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,\u201d says researcher Niels Birbaumer.

The Post also looks at Cosby's marriage to Camille Cosby, saying \"it\u2019s unclear how much Camille knew about her husband\u2019s activities\" since six of the alleged sexual assaults occurred at his house. She was reportedly aware of his \"selfish\" behavior in Los Angeles, which contrasted with his upstanding life on the East Coast as a man studying for a PhD and sitting on a board at Temple University. Yet even there, a Temple employee accuses him of drugging her with blue pills and sexually assaulting her.

The scandal led to the indictment of several high-ranking officials, including former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and former Port Authority executive director, Bill Baroni.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe scandal began on September 9, 2013, when two of the three toll lanes at the George Washington Bridge were closed, causing significant traffic congestion in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The closures were allegedly ordered by David Wildstein, a Christie appointee at the Port Authority, as a form of political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not endorsing Christie's re-election campaign.\n\n**Investigation and Charges**\n\nThe scandal led to a 16-month investigation, which resulted in charges against Kelly and Baroni. Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to his role in the scandal, testified that he discussed the plot with multiple members of Christie's senior staff before and during the lane closures. Christie was never charged in connection with the lane closures, but the scandal is seen as contributing to his failed bid for the Republican nomination for President.\n\n**Citizen's Complaint**\n\nA citizen's complaint was filed against Christie in Bergen County, alleging that he knew of the lane closures while they were happening and failed to stop them. The complaint, filed by William Brennan, a retired Teaneck firefighter and citizen activist, alleges that Christie's failure to end the closures constitutes second-degree official misconduct, a charge punishable by five to 10 years in prison. A judge in Bergen County ruled that there is probable cause to believe that an event of official misconduct was caused by Christie, and the case will now go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office to decide whether to bring an indictment against Christie.\n\n**Federal Trial**\n\nThe federal trial of Kelly and Baroni is ongoing, with the government resting its case after 15 days and 18 witnesses. The government's final witness was FBI agent Michelle Pickels, who testified that she was unable to recover some of Kelly's emails, including the infamous \"time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\" from Kelly's Yahoo account, suggesting they were deleted. Baroni has begun presenting his defense, with his first witness being Christie's former general counsel, Charlie McKenna.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe Bridgegate scandal has had a significant impact on Christie", "answers": ["A citizen's official misconduct complaint against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie can move forward, a judge in the state ruled Thursday. Bill Brennan, whom the Star-Ledger describes as a \"citizen activist\" and Christie's office describes as \"a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,\" filed the complaint last month over the 2013 BridgeGate scandal. Per Brennan's complaint, Christie knew lane closures were happening and could have put a stop to the whole thing. The complaint is based on testimony from the trial against former Christie aide Bridget Anne Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni. During the trial, a man Christie appointed to Port Authority testified that both he and Baroni told Christie about the lane closures during a 9/11 ceremony (the lanes were closed from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13, 2013). Now that the judge has ruled the complaint can move forward, it will go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office so a decision can be made as to whether Christie should be indicted. Christie's office, which insists the governor had no knowledge of the lane closures while they were ongoing, said it would appeal the judge's ruling. The Star-Ledger reports that the courtroom audience, \"mostly there for minor criminal violations,\" applauded the judge's ruling.

The spacecraft, set to launch in July 2018, will venture closer to the sun than any previous mission, within 3.7 million miles of its surface. This historic mission aims to unlock the secrets of solar storms, which can impact satellites, power supplies, and even the Earth's power grid.\n\n**The Mission's Objectives**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will investigate the origins of solar wind, the flow of charged particles from the sun that affects the solar system. The mission will also study the heating of the sun's corona, the outer layer of the sun's atmosphere, which is hotter than its surface. The spacecraft will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n**The Science Behind the Mission**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with four science instruments to study the sun's magnetic fields, solar wind, and corona. The mission will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The findings will also provide insight into the physics of stars and the mysterious corona.\n\n**The Significance of the Mission**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a groundbreaking mission that will revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its impact on the solar system. The mission will also help protect equipment from solar radiation and improve forecasting of major space weather events. The spacecraft will be the first to visit the sun's corona, a region of space that has never been explored before.\n\n**The Tribute to Eugene Parker**\n\nThe mission is a tribute to Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. Parker is the first researcher to be celebrated in this manner while still alive. The spacecraft will carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying his message to the sun.\n\n**The Launch Window**\n\nThe 20-day launch window opens on July 31, 2018. After testing the assembly, the spacecraft will arrive at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to prep for launch. The mission is scheduled to end in June 2025.\n\n**The Impact of the Mission**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will have a significant impact on our understanding of the sun and its impact on the solar system.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "length": 10147}

He was a charismatic leader who rose to the rank of comandante in the rebel army, but his actions and loyalties were often questioned by his comrades and the Cuban government. Morgan was accused of being a CIA operative, but declassified documents suggest that he was not.\n\nMorgan's relationship with Olga Goodwin was a central part of his life, and she has become a key figure in his story. The two met while fighting in the mountains, and Morgan's love for her was a driving force throughout his life.
