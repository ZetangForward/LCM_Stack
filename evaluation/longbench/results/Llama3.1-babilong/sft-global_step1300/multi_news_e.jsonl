The report, which details the CIA's use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists, is said to be a scathing indictment of the program.\n\nThe CIA has been accused of monitoring Senate computers used by committee staff to prepare the report, potentially violating an agreement between the committee and the agency. The monitoring may have also violated the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it a crime to intentionally access a computer without authorization or to go beyond what one is allowed to access.\n\nThe CIA has disputed some of the report's findings, and the White House has closely tracked the dispute but has not directly intervened. The report's release has been delayed for nearly 15 months, with the CIA controlling the declassification process.\n\nSenator Mark Udall, a champion of government transparency, has urged President Barack Obama to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the report and to strip the CIA of control over the declassification process. Udall has also threatened to block the nomination of Caroline Krass to be CIA general counsel unless significant progress is made on his previous requests.\n\nThe CIA Inspector General's Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the agency related to the report.

These proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, thereby preventing the fish from freezing over. However, a recent study has revealed a paradoxical consequence of this adaptation: the AFPs also inhibit the melting of ice crystals, leading to their accumulation inside the fish's bodies.\n\nResearchers have found that the AFPs prevent ice crystals from melting even at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP). This means that the fish are unable to rid themselves of the ice crystals, which can accumulate in their spleens and potentially cause problems in other parts of the body. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the fish may have evolved a mechanism to clear the ice from their circulation, but the long-term cost of this adaptation is still unknown.\n\nThe researchers used a combination of laboratory experiments and field observations to study the behavior of AFPs in Antarctic notothenioid fish. They found that the ice crystals persisted inside the fish even after raising the temperature to levels that would normally cause them to melt. The study's lead author, Paul Cziko, notes that the AFPs work differently from traditional antifreeze agents, binding to the ice crystals and altering their surface to prevent growth.\n\nThe discovery of superheated ice in the fish's bodies is a new phenomenon that has been observed in nature. Cziko suggests that this may be the first example of \"superheating\" found in nature, where ice remains intact even above its melting point. The long-term effects of this adaptation on the fish's health are still unknown, but researchers speculate that it may lead to problems in the fish's circulation and potentially even death.\n\nThe study highlights the complex and often counterintuitive nature of evolution, where seemingly beneficial adaptations can come with unintended consequences.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "**Pacific Sardine Population Decline Threatens West Coast Ecosystem**\n\nThe Pacific sardine population, a crucial forage fish species, is experiencing a severe decline along the West Coast of North America. This decline has significant implications for the marine ecosystem, as sardines are a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna.\n\nAccording to the Pacific Fishery Management Council, the current population of 378,000 tons is the lowest in over a decade, down from a peak of 1.5 million tons in 2000. The decline has led to steep cuts in catch limits, but some environmental groups are calling for a complete halt to fishing to prevent further decline and allow the population to recover.\n\nScientists are unsure of the cause of the decline, but point to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines. However, the decline is also raising concerns about overfishing and the impact of fishing on the ecosystem.\n\nThe decline of sardines is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with many species struggling to find alternative food sources. For example, sea lions are malnourished due to the scarcity of sardines, and their pups are washing up on beaches in alarming numbers. The Pacific sardine is considered a \"boom-bust\" fish, with populations fluctuating wildly in response to changes in ocean conditions.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council is being urged to take action to protect the sardine population, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The council has committed to fulfilling its 2013 promise to manage forage fish species, but more needs to be done to address the crisis.\n\nThe value of sardines as forage fish is significant, with a 2012 study estimating that they are worth twice as much when left in the water as they are when caught. The decline of sardines has far-reaching implications for the West Coast ecosystem and highlights the need for sustainable fishing practices and effective management of marine resources.\n\n**Key Statistics:**\n\n* Current sardine population: 378,000 tons (lowest in over a decade)\n* Peak sardine population: 1.5 million tons (2000)\n* Decline since 2006: 72%\n* Catch limits cut by over two-thirds in November\n", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment\u2014the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans\u2014which also depend on sardines for food\u2014are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)\u2014and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "length": 0}

Kissinger noted that Sharon had undertaken a long journey to reach this insight and had made significant gestures towards peace, including the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza and the return of the territory to Arab self-rule.\n\nHowever, Kissinger also acknowledged that the result of Sharon's efforts did not justify his actions, and that the peace process was under attack from all sides.

The study, which analyzed data from over 11,000 adults in the US, found that while only 2% of the population currently follows a vegetarian or vegan diet, 10% have been vegetarian or vegan in the past but have since reverted to eating meat.\n\nThe study reveals that most people who give up a vegetarian or vegan diet do so within the first year, with a third abandoning their animal-free diet in just three months. The main reasons for quitting include social pressures, difficulty maintaining a \"pure diet,\" and not seeing their diet as part of their identity. In contrast, current vegetarians and vegans have a wide range of motivations, including animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that people who transitioned to a vegetarian or vegan diet quickly (in a few days or weeks) are less likely to stick to it in the long term. This suggests that a slower approach to adopting a plant-based diet may lead to more sustainable results.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of relationships in influencing people's dietary choices. A third of former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarian or non-vegan partner when they went back to eating meat. This finding suggests that having a supportive social network can play a crucial role in maintaining a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n\nThe HRC study's findings have significant implications for advocacy and outreach strategies. The report recommends that advocates focus on promoting reduction in animal product consumption rather than demanding complete elimination of animal products. This approach may be more effective in creating a cultural shift towards a more plant-based diet.\n\nIn a personal account, a former vegetarian shares their own experience of giving up a vegetarian diet.

This change aims to speed up the game, but not everyone is pleased with the decision.\n\nThe new rule, which was approved for the current season, eliminates the possibility of a batter scoring on an errant pitch during an intentional walk, as previously seen in instances where the pitcher threw the ball too close to the strike zone. However, some players and fans are nostalgic for the old way, citing the excitement of a botched intentional walk.\n\nThe change is expected to shave off a mere 35 seconds per game, with intentional walks taking an estimated 37.25 seconds on average. This is a relatively small reduction, leading some to question the necessity of the rule change. In 2016, intentional walks accounted for just 1.5 pitches per game.\n\nThe MLB is also considering further changes to speed up the game, including eliminating the four-pitch intentional walk altogether. However, some fans are suggesting alternative ways to make the game more exciting, such as having the center fielder throw the intentional walk from a minimum of 300 feet away.\n\nIn a lighter vein, Twitter users have been sharing humorous suggestions for the new dugout signal, including mimicking the \"Walk like an Egyptian\" dance and other creative gestures. While the new rule may not drastically alter the pace of the game, it marks a significant change in the way intentional walks are handled in professional baseball.", "answers": ["Those who complain baseball is too slow may be heartened to hear a quicker pace is on its way.

Instead, teams can now simply signal the ump that a walk is in the works, and the runner can immediately saunter over to first. This change could shave 14.3 seconds off of each game, per estimates by the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Post notes \"not everyone is thrilled\" with the change, including those who enjoy watching what happens when intentional-walk pitches go wild or batters go for them anyway.

According to a comprehensive analysis of data from 2010-2011, nearly a third of all antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings are unnecessary, resulting in approximately 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year. This staggering figure translates to about 13% of all outpatient visits in the US, with 44% of antibiotic prescriptions written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), found that half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because they are for viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics. The overuse of antibiotics has led to the rise of drug-resistant superbugs, posing a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. The CDC has warned that \"nightmare bacteria\" are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics, causing an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths every year in the US.\n\nThe White House has set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020, which would require a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use. This goal can be achieved by implementing simple steps such as displaying posters in patient waiting rooms, educating patients about the dangers of antibiotic overuse, and improving communication between doctors and patients.\n\nThe study highlights the need for a concerted effort to address the issue of antibiotic resistance. Health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole must work together to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and preserve these life-saving drugs for patients who really need them. The Pew Charitable Trusts and the CDC are preparing a similar report on inpatient antibiotic prescribing, which will set national targets for reducing unnecessary use in hospitals and be released in 2017.\n\nThe consequences of inaction are dire. Losing antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections, cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma. The overuse of antibiotics has already led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. It is imperative that we take immediate action to address this public health crisis and preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics for future generations.", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2014the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post\u2014isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections\u2014meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 0}

This approach has been made possible by new legal guidance that allows for the prosecution of former Nazis who helped to operate the camps.\n\nOne of the survivors of the Stutthof camp, Judith Meisel, 88, has been instrumental in bringing about the indictments. Meisel, who is from St. Louis Park, Minnesota, identified one of the ex-guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted and beat prisoners.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "**Title:** Encouraging Girls to Become Leaders: A Call to Action\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAs we mark the 20th anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, it's time to shift the focus from simply demystifying the workplace to encouraging girls to become leaders. The Ms. Foundation's original mission has been accomplished, and now it's essential to take girls to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work. This is crucial because women's rates of top leadership have barely budged in the past 20 years, despite making up half the US workforce.\n\nThe problem lies not in a lack of ambition, but in a lack of encouragement and opportunities. Companies need to do more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the \"ambition gap.\" To address this, companies can introduce girls to female role models, explain what leadership entails, and support programs that actively identify and groom female talent.\n\nIntroducing girls to women at the highest level of the company can make a significant difference. A recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80% of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60% have not been offered the opportunity to see them in action. Companies can use Take Our Children to Work Day to introduce their employees' daughters to women at the top of the company and highlight their accomplishments.\n\nMoreover, girls need to understand what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis. They need to know how executives motivate teams, solve complex financial problems, and develop new products. This will help make leadership more tangible and resolve the issue of girls feeling uncomfortable trying to lead.\n\nTo achieve real breakthroughs, companies and schools need proactive efforts to move women into leadership roles. Princeton University's success in increasing the number of female students winning top academic honors and holding visible leadership roles is a model to follow. The university's faculty proactively encouraged female students to apply for academic prizes, resulting in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.\n\nIn corporate environments, sponsorship is key. Sponsors spend their political capital on behalf of their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, providing opportunities instead of merely advice. Companies that have formal sponsorship initiatives are more likely to achieve diversity.\n\nUltimately, simply showing girls what an office looks like is no longer enough. We need to take our daughters into the C-suite now so they can lead in the future. By taking these steps, we can close the leadership gap and create a more inclusive and equitable workplace.", "answers": ["Today is the 20th anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, and Jennifer Allyn at the Christian Science Monitor says it's time to declare mission accomplished and refocus on a bigger goal. Two decades ago, it was enough to get young girls in the workplace and \"demystify\" the whole concept of women getting a job. Now it's time to introduce girls to the executive suites, to give them role models of women as decision-makers. Girls still tend not to see themselves getting leadership positions as adults, and that's because they don't get to see enough real-life examples. \"Simply showing our daughters what an office looks like is no longer enough,\" writes Allen. \"Real breakthroughs will come when we bring girls inside the halls of power.

The ship ran aground off the coast of Haiti in December 1492 and was the largest vessel in Columbus's three-ship fleet that discovered the New World.\n\nClifford had announced in May that he had discovered the wreck, citing geographical, underwater topography, and archaeological evidence. However, a team of experts from UNESCO, led by Xavier Nieto Prieto, concluded that the fasteners found at the site indicated a ship from the late 17th or 18th century, rather than the 15th or 16th century. The team also found that the site was further away from shore than expected, contradicting historical accounts of the wreck.\n\nUNESCO's report has been met with criticism from some experts, including Professor Charles Beeker of Indiana University, who had been conducting a preliminary investigation of the site. Beeker believes that Clifford's site is still the best candidate for the wreck of the Santa Maria and that the bronze fasteners found at the site are not sufficient reason to dismiss it without further investigation.\n\nUNESCO has now proposed searching for the Santa Maria in two areas of marshland along the north coast of Haiti, near the towns of En Bas Saline and La Petite Anse. However, many scholars are skeptical of this plan, arguing that the ship could not have reached these areas due to shallow and dangerous reefs.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Santa Maria's wreck has implications for the US public's perception of UNESCO, as the United States has refused to pay its financial contribution to the organization for the past three years and was stripped of its voting rights last year. The US-led investigation of the site was also rejected by UNESCO, which has been replaced by a partly European team.\n\nThe search for the Santa Maria's wreck continues, with Clifford calling for UNESCO to investigate the entire area where the lombard cannons were found.

UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area.

Since 2012, nine women in Sweden have received transplanted wombs, with four of them already having embryos transferred into their new wombs.\n\nThe transplanted wombs were donated by the women's mothers or close relatives, a technique that is considered controversial by some experts.

The team is optimistic that three or four of the women may successfully give birth, which would be a world first.\n\nThe procedure is still in its experimental stages, and the women will have to take medication to prevent their bodies from rejecting the transplanted womb. They will also be closely monitored throughout their pregnancy to ensure the health of both the mother and the baby. The transplanted wombs will be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies.\n\nWhile the research is promising, experts have raised concerns about the physiological changes that may occur in the transplanted womb and how it will affect the mother and the baby.

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is a significant finding, as it suggests that homeowners with west-facing solar panels can reduce their peak energy usage by 65%, while those with south-facing panels can reduce their usage by 54%.\n\nThe study's lead researcher, Brewster McCracken, explained that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy in the late afternoon, which coincides with the time when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, increasing their energy usage. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are optimizing their solar power generation at the exact time when their energy usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.\n\nThe study's findings have the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market, as it opens up the possibility of installing solar panels on homes with east-west roof pitches, which were previously thought to be unsuitable for solar energy generation. Additionally, the study suggests that utility companies may need to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, as they can help reduce the stress on the grid during peak demand periods.\n\nWhile the study's results are promising, it's essential to note that the study was conducted during the summer months, and the outcome may vary in different regions and during other seasons. David Mooney, a laboratory program manager at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, noted that the benefits of west-facing panels may not be applicable in all regions, such as Colorado, where the summer sun is often obscured by clouds.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate among solar industry experts, with some questioning the conventional wisdom that south-facing panels are always the best option.

Recent studies have shed light on \u00d6tzi's dental health, genetic makeup, and lifestyle.\n\n**Dental Health**\n\nA new study published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences reveals that \u00d6tzi suffered from severe gum disease and cavities, likely due to his diet of coarse grain and whole-grain bread.

However, some have questioned whether the incident was a publicity stunt to draw attention to the struggling play. Silvestri's friend had posted a video of the incident on YouTube, which quickly went viral.\n\nMeanwhile, another incident occurred at the Off-Broadway play \"Shows for Days,\" where actress Patti LuPone, a Tony-winner, snatched a phone from an audience member's hand during a performance. LuPone, who plays a small-town theater diva in the play, had previously been disrupted by ringtones and texting during the show. She expressed her frustration with the issue, stating that it ruins the experience for everyone else and has even made her question whether she wants to continue working on stage.\n\nThis is not the first time LuPone has taken a stand against audience rudeness and technology. In 2009, she stopped a performance of \"Gypsy\" to upbraid an audience member for taking pictures. Other notable incidents include a 2011 incident where Frances McDormand stopped a performance of \"Good People\" when an audience member answered their phone during a crucial moment.\n\nThe incidents have sparked a debate about the etiquette of cell phone usage during live theater performances.

An investigation is underway to determine how the mistake occurred, with officials citing a breakdown in communication between builders and local authorities.\n\nThis incident is not an isolated case, as ancient relics and monuments have been destroyed in various parts of the world due to a range of reasons. In 2007, a work crew in Nanjing, China, intentionally destroyed the burial sites of 10 noblemen from six dynasties. Similarly, an ancient Native American burial ground and village in California was discovered and razed last year to make way for multimillion-dollar homes.\n\nIn some cases, the destruction of ancient relics is not intentional, but rather a result of ignorance or lack of knowledge. For instance, workers in Belize destroyed a 2,300-year-old Mayan pyramid in 2013 to use the rubble for road repair, unaware that it was a Mayan ruin. These incidents highlight the importance of preserving our cultural heritage and the need for effective communication and coordination between authorities and builders.\n\nThe incident in Spain has sparked concerns about the preservation of ancient monuments and relics, with archaeologist Juan Barcel\u00f3 stating that mistakes like this are not representative of Spain, where monuments over 100 years old are protected by law.

In an interview with GQ, Swift addressed claims made by Grizzly Bear's Edward Droste that she is \"terribly calculated and mean.\" Swift strongly disagreed with the accusations, stating that she thinks about things before they happen, but that doesn't mean she is calculating. She also emphasized the importance of self-awareness in her career, saying that she tries to preserve it as she navigates the pressures of fame.\n\nSwift also spoke about her song \"Bad Blood,\" which many people believe is about her feud with Katy Perry. However, Swift claimed that the song is actually about the loss of a friendship, and that she deliberately avoided saying who the song was about to avoid pointing fingers at her ex-boyfriend. She also revealed that she closely monitors what people say about her online, and that she has a strategy for managing her public image.\n\nIn another interview with GQ, Swift discussed her personal life and how it intersects with her career. She talked about her childhood, including a painful experience in middle school where she was rejected by her peers, which she later referenced in her song \"The Best Day.\" She also spoke about her friendships, saying that she values them deeply and has made a conscious effort to surround herself with supportive people.\n\nSwift also addressed the infamous incident at the 2009 VMAs, where Kanye West stormed the stage and interrupted her acceptance speech. She revealed that she was initially hurt by the incident, but that she has since made amends with West and even presented him with the Video Vanguard award at the VMAs this year.\n\nIn a lighter moment, Swift talked about her love of TV shows, including Friends, and how she often watches it to relax after a long day of performing. She also joked about her busy schedule, saying that she often feels like she's surrounded by people, but that she doesn't feel lonely because she's so focused on her work.\n\nOverall, Swift's interviews have given fans a glimpse into her thought process and her approach to her career and personal life.

The contest has narrowed down to a three-way dead heat among Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, and Rick Santorum, according to the latest Iowa Poll. However, 41% of voters still have not made up their minds, indicating that the outcome is far from certain.\n\nRomney, the current front-runner, is banking on his electability as a key factor in his success. He has poured significant resources into Iowa and is expected to perform well, particularly in areas with high turnout. However, a poor showing could raise questions about his ability to win over the Republican base.\n\nRon Paul, on the other hand, is relying on his army of college activists and a strong ground game to propel him to victory. His campaign has been boosted by a surge in popularity, despite facing criticism for his past publication of a racist and anti-Semitic newsletter. Paul's message of liberty and limited government has resonated with many young voters and independents.\n\nRick Santorum, a Christian conservative from Pennsylvania, has seen a surge in support in recent days, particularly among social conservatives and evangelicals. He has raised more money in the last few days than in the previous few months and is expected to perform well in areas with high concentrations of these voters.\n\nOther candidates, including Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, and Rick Perry, are struggling to gain traction. Gingrich has seen a significant decline in the polls and is now in fourth place, while Bachmann's campaign has been marred by internal dysfunction and a lack of resources. Perry, who is in fifth place, is trying to make a final push for the nomination, but his campaign has been plagued by gaffes and a lack of momentum.\n\nThe outcome of the Iowa caucuses will be closely watched, as it will set the tone for the rest of the primary season. A win for Romney would all but secure his nomination, while a loss could raise questions about his electability. A victory for Paul or Santorum would be a significant upset and could propel them to the forefront of the nomination process.\n\nIn terms of key counties to watch, Black Hawk County is expected to be a battleground, with a strong organized labor presence and a history of voting Democratic.

The study, conducted by researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University, analyzed data from over 21,000 pregnancies and found that women who consumed two to four servings of potatoes or chips per week had a 27% higher risk of developing gestational diabetes. Those who ate more than five portions of potatoes or chips per week had a 50% higher risk.\n\nThe researchers propose that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grains may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. They estimate that swapping two servings of potatoes per week for other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods could lower the risk by 9-12%.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Cuilin Zhang, suggests that women can reduce their risk of gestational diabetes by making simple swaps, such as switching from baked or mashed potatoes to sweet potatoes or boiled new potatoes, choosing whole grain bread instead of white bread, and swapping frozen microwaveable French fries for pasta or noodles.\n\nHowever, UK experts have cautioned that the study's findings are not conclusive and that more research is needed to confirm the association between potato consumption and gestational diabetes. They also note that potatoes are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and that women should not completely eliminate them from their diet.\n\nDr. Emily Burns of Diabetes UK stated that the study does not prove that eating potatoes before pregnancy will increase a woman's risk of developing gestational diabetes, but it does highlight a potential association between the two. Dr. Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, emphasized that the evidence suggests that women should eat more starchy foods, including potatoes, as part of a balanced diet.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has linked high-glycemic foods to a higher risk of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Dr. Aldo Palmieri of UCLA Santa Monica Hospital noted that potatoes are carbohydrates and can elevate blood sugar levels, but moderation is key.\n\nThe study's limitations include a lack of diversity in the participant population, with 90% being white, and a generally healthy population of nurses.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "The mystery of the H.L. Hunley, a Confederate submarine that sank during the American Civil War, has been solved by a team of researchers led by Rachel Lance, a biomechanist from Duke University. The submarine, which was the first to sink an enemy ship in combat, had been a mystery for over 150 years, with various theories attempting to explain its sinking, including suffocation, damage from arms fire, and a lucky shot from a Union sailor.\n\nLance's research, published in the journal PLoS One, suggests that the crew of the Hunley died instantly from the shockwave generated by their own torpedo. The submarine's crew had set off a 61.2 kg (135 lb) black powder torpedo at a distance of less than 5 m (16 ft) off its bow, which caused a blast that likely flexed the ship's hull and transmitted a secondary wave into the crew compartment. This wave would have caused catastrophic injuries to the crew, particularly to their lungs and brains, resulting in instant death.\n\nLance's research involved constructing a 1/6 length-scaled model of the Hunley, which was exposed to underwater blasts using shock tubes and live charges. The results showed that the blast wave would have been strong enough to cause fatal injuries to the crew, even if they were seated at their stations and not attempting to escape.\n\nThe Hunley's sinking occurred on February 17, 1864, when it attacked the Union ship USS Housatonic.

Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai.

The report, titled \"Growing Up on Death Row: The Death Penalty and Juvenile Offenders in Iran,\" reveals that between 2005 and 2015, at least 73 juvenile offenders were executed, and currently, at least 160 are on death row.\n\nThe Iranian government has made some attempts to reform its laws, but these efforts have been deemed insufficient by human rights organizations. The 2013 Islamic Penal Code allows judges to assess a juvenile offender's mental maturity at the time of the offense and potentially impose an alternative punishment to the death penalty. However, this provision has not been consistently applied, and many juvenile offenders continue to face the death penalty.\n\nIran's ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in 1994 has also been criticized for its reservations, which state that the country will not abide by the convention if it conflicts with domestic laws and Islamic standards. This reservation has been seen as a way for the government to circumvent its international obligations.\n\nIn addition to the issue of juvenile offenders, Iran has also been criticized for its treatment of children in general.

The program involved thousands of men and women working together to achieve this monumental task. The Apollo 11 mission, which successfully landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, marked a major milestone in space exploration.\n\n**The Apollo 11 Mission**\n\nThe Apollo 11 crew, consisting of Neil Armstrong, Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin, and Michael Collins, embarked on a historic journey to the moon. The mission began with a successful launch on July 16, 1969, and the crew entered into lunar orbit on July 19. The next day, Armstrong and Aldrin suited up in their spacesuits and descended to the moon's surface in the lunar module Eagle. At 2:56 UTC on July 21, Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the moon, famously declaring, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\n**Life on the Moon**\n\nThe Apollo 11 astronauts spent about two and a half hours on the moon's surface, collecting samples and conducting experiments. They also planted the United States flag and left behind a plaque that read, \"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\" The crew returned to the lunar module and lifted off from the moon at 23:54 UTC on July 21, rejoining Collins in orbit around the moon.\n\n**The Return Journey**\n\nAfter completing their moonwalk, the Apollo 11 crew began their journey back to Earth. They splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969, and were recovered by the USS Hornet aircraft carrier. The crew was greeted as heroes, and their historic achievement was celebrated around the world.\n\n**The Challenges of Space Travel**\n\nThe Apollo program also highlighted the challenges of space travel, including the need for a reliable and efficient way to manage human waste. The early spaceflights, such as the Mercury program, did not have a dedicated bathroom system, and astronauts had to rely on makeshift solutions, such as a garter belt with a condom and a collection bag. The Gemini program introduced a urine collection system, but it was not sufficient for longer missions. The Apollo program eventually developed a more sophisticated system, including a diaper for moonwalkers, but accidents still occurred.\n\n**Legacy of the Apollo", "answers": ["It was a mission-critical element: the size of NASA astronauts' manhood. Seriously. The Houston Chronicle resurrects the fascinating historical tidbit by way of the Science Channel's Moon Machines documentary series, in which engineer Donald Rethke explained the very precise nature of early space diapers. The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit\u2014forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

Pitzer noted that the passages in Dylan's speech do not appear in the novel itself, but rather in the SparkNotes summary.\n\nThis is not the first time Dylan has been accused of lifting passages from other works.

And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it). What some believe: Brunke may have paid off Cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of Cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame. The cryptic statement Cordell offered in court when asked about a money exchange only fueled that suspicion: \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" Cordell was sentenced to life in prison, per WLUC; Brunke will likely get five years or less for obstructing justice and lying to a cop when he's sentenced Jan. 21.

In Pennsylvania, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver during a fatal accident can be held liable for the accident, setting a precedent that third-party texters can be held accountable if they are aware the driver is texting and will view the text while on the road. This decision follows a 2013 New Jersey appellate ruling that established the same cause of action against third parties in motor vehicle accident litigation.\n\nIn a separate case, a New York lawmaker proposed a \"textalyzer\" bill that would allow police officers to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that isn't in accordance with state laws. The bill also proposes that drivers would be forced to hand over their phone after a wreck or risk a driver's license suspension.\n\nThese developments may signal a change in thinking regarding distracted driving, making it a more stigmatized behavior. However, it remains to be seen whether phone and app developers will be held accountable for accidents caused by their products. Some experts believe that manufacturers or technology that endangers lives tends to have a better chance of remaining immune from legal repercussions.\n\nIn a related case, an Uber driver who was injured in a crash caused by a Snapchat user who was driving recklessly at 107 mph is suing the company for \"motivating\" the driver to drive recklessly. The case highlights the growing concern over the role of social media and apps in contributing to distracted driving.\n\nThe issue of liability for distracted driving is complex, and courts are grappling with the question of whether those who send texts to drivers can be held responsible for accidents caused by the driver's distraction. A recent court ruling in New Jersey held that a person sending a text message can potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting, but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted.\n\nThe court's decision was based on a 2013 ruling by a New Jersey appeals court that also involved the culpability of someone who sent a text to a driver involved in a car crash. The court held that the sender of a text message can potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting, but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted.\n\nThe issue of liability for distracted driving is likely to continue to evolve as courts and lawmakers grapple with", "answers": ["Court rulings in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are taking texting-while-driving laws down a new road, opening the door to not only holding the offending driver liable for a car accident, but perhaps also the person texting the driver, Consumerist reports.

And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver\u2014it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin \u2026 an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

The operation, which lasted for seven hours, saw police fire nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition in a battle with a group holed up in two apartments.

Three suspects were arrested inside the building, while outside police took into custody a man who lent the apartment to the jihadists and a woman accompanying him. Two men were arrested after being found in the rubble, and an eighth man, who was injured and found outside, was also taken into custody believed to have been involved in providing the apartment.\n\n**Investigation and Evidence**\n\nThe police assault was the result of a gargantuan probe undertaken since the Friday attacks, which saw police pore over video footage, telephone surveillance, and witness reports. A witness report received Monday led investigators to believe that Abaaoud, a known Belgian jihadist believed to be in Syria, was in fact on French territory. The police also discovered a cellphone belonging to one of the attackers in a dustbin outside the Bataclan music venue, scene of the worst violence, where 89 people were gunned down.

This gap has been rising dramatically since the 1990s, with some fluctuations. In 1965, the ratio of CEO to worker pay was 20 to one, which rose to 58 to one by 1989 and peaked in 2000 at 344 times the wage of their average worker.\n\nThe report highlights that CEO pay has been rising rapidly since 2009, with some CEOs earning millions of dollars in compensation. For example, McDonald's boss Steve Easterbrook earned $21.7 million in 2017, while the average McDonald's worker earned just $7,017. Similarly, Walmart's CEO Doug McMillon took home $22.8 million in 2017, while the average Walmart worker earned $19,177.\n\nThe report also notes that the pay gap is not just limited to the top CEOs, but also affects the broader workforce. The Economic Policy Institute found that the redistribution of wages to the top 5% and 1% of earners has affected the wage growth of the bottom 90%. If the wages of the bottom 90% had grown at the same rate as the top 5% and 1%, they could have grown twice as fast as they actually did.\n\nThe report attributes the rise in CEO pay to the loosening of norms and the desire of companies to pay their CEOs more than their peers.

However, a recent study has found that older fathers may also have a surprising benefit: they are more likely to have \"geekier\" sons.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers at King's College London, analyzed data from 15,000 twins and found that sons of older fathers scored higher on the \"Geek Index,\" a measure of geeky traits such as non-verbal IQ, focus, and social aloofness. The study found that the older the father, the higher the score.\n\nThe researchers also found that the Geek Index was strongly associated with future academic attainment, particularly in STEM subjects. Sons of older fathers were more likely to excel in these areas and were 32% more likely to achieve two A or A* grades at GCSE than sons of younger fathers.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Magdalena Janecka, said that the findings suggest that older fathers may be passing on genetic traits that contribute to geekiness and academic success. However, she also noted that the study does not mean that men should delay fatherhood in order to have more intelligent sons.\n\nOther researchers have suggested that the link between older fathers and geekier sons may be due to the fact that older men are more likely to have stable, better-paid jobs and a home setting that encourages geeky traits. However, Dr. Janecka cautioned that the study's findings should not be taken to guide individual decisions about parenthood.\n\nThe study's results have sparked debate about the potential benefits of older fatherhood. Some researchers have suggested that the trend towards delayed parenthood may lead to a \"society of geniuses\" that is better equipped to solve the world's problems. However, others have warned that the dangers of older parenting, such as an increased risk of infertility and miscarriage, should not be ignored.\n\nOverall, the study's findings suggest that older fathers may have a surprising benefit: they are more likely to have geekier sons who excel in STEM subjects. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between paternal age and geekiness.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Sons of older fathers scored higher on the Geek Index, a measure of geeky traits such as non-verbal IQ, focus, and social aloofness.\n* The older the father, the higher the score on the Geek Index.\n* The Geek Index was strongly associated with future academic", "answers": ["A new study suggests an upside for boys who have older dads: higher IQs.

And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it\u2019s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King\u2019s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. \u201cOur primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those \u2018geeky\u2019 traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of \u2018geekiness.\u2019\u201d (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"], "length": 0}

In 2015, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies filed a permit to build a 5-mile prototype in Quay Valley, a planned community in California, but the project still requires approval.\n\nAnother challenge is the human factor. The Hyperloop system would involve frequent acceleration and deceleration, which could cause nausea and discomfort for passengers. To mitigate this, the Hyperloop Pod Competition sponsored by Elon Musk and SpaceX requires teams to construct pods that go at least 240 miles per hour.\n\n**Public Interest and Engagement**\n\nTo raise awareness and interest in the Hyperloop concept, a team called rLoop has created a browser game called Break-a-Pod, which simulates the experience of riding in a Hyperloop pod. The game has been released as part of an IndieGoGo campaign to raise funds for the development of a prototype pod.\n\n**Competitors and Partnerships**\n\nSeveral companies are competing to develop the Hyperloop technology, including Hyperloop One, HTT, and SpaceX. Hyperloop One has partnered with Danish architect Bjarke Ingels to design its stations and infrastructure. HTT has licensed passive magnetic levitation technology from Lawrence Livermore National Labs and has partnered with NASA.\n\n**Future Prospects**\n\nWhile the Hyperloop concept is still in its early stages, it has the potential to revolutionize transportation and reduce travel times between cities. However, significant challenges need to be overcome before the technology can become a reality.", "answers": ["The age of uber-quick \"hyperloop\" transportation had a milestone Wednesday: One of the companies hoping to turn the idea into reality successfully tested its propulsion system in the desert near Las Vegas, Mashable reports.

The dossier contains allegations of Trump's connections to Russia, including claims of compromising information that could be used to blackmail him.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League and the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect condemned Trump for trivializing the Holocaust to score a political point. Trump's comments were seen as insensitive and ignorant of history.\n\nMeanwhile, a former western European counter-intelligence official collected information on Trump's ties to Russia, which was later passed to the FBI. The information was part of a larger opposition research project that was initially commissioned by a Republican opponent of Trump in the primary campaign. The project was later taken over by a Democratic client, and the information was used to compile the dossier.\n\nThe dossier was eventually passed to Senator John McCain, who handed it over to the FBI. The FBI included a summary of the dossier in its highly classified briefing to the president and president-elect, but it is unclear why they did so. The dossier was later leaked to CNN, which reported on the material, and then published by BuzzFeed in its entirety.\n\nThe release of the dossier has sparked a heated debate, with some media outlets and Democratic operatives treating the allegations as credible, while others have questioned their validity. The dossier's author, Christopher Steele, is a former British intelligence officer who was hired by a private security-and-investigations firm to compile the document.\n\nThe controversy has also led to a renewed push by Democrats to investigate Trump's ties to Russia and to question his legitimacy as president-elect. Some Democrats have called for an independent, bipartisan commission to probe Russia's meddling in the election, while others have suggested that Trump's refusal to agree with the intelligence community's findings on Russia's attempts to collect compromising information on him undermines his legitimacy.\n\nPresident-elect Trump has denied the allegations made in the dossier, calling them completely fabricated.

The pretzel croissant, created by Maury Rubin at his City Bakery in New York, has been a staple in the city's breakfast scene, while the Cronut, a croissant-doughnut hybrid, has become a viral sensation at Dominique Ansel's bakery in SoHo. The Cronut's success has led to a wave of imitations, with Dunkin' Donuts introducing its own version, the Croissant Donut, which will be launched nationally for a limited time starting November 3, 2014.\n\nMaury Rubin, a former Emmy-winning television producer and director, turned to baking after a stint in France, where he learned the art of pastry-making. He opened City Bakery in 1990 and introduced the pretzel croissant, which has been a profit center for the bakery. Rubin has been critical of the Cronut, calling it a \"hula-hoop moment\" that relies on the blogosphere for its success, rather than true innovation.\n\nDominique Ansel, the creator of the Cronut, has a classical French culinary education and has worked in some of the top kitchens in Paris. He opened his own bakery in SoHo, where he introduced the Cronut, which became an instant hit. Ansel has resisted the commercialization of the Cronut, choosing to keep it a limited offering and focusing on other creative pastries.\n\nDunkin' Donuts' Croissant Donut, on the other hand, will be a more mass-produced version of the pastry, with a familiar glaze and no cream filling. The company claims that it is not copying the Cronut, but rather responding to consumer demand for pastry combinations. The Croissant Donut will be priced at $2.49, less than the $5 price of the Cronut, but more than twice the price of a standard Dunkin' doughnut.\n\nThe rise of these hybridized pastries has led to a shift in the way people think about baking and pastry-making. Pastry chefs are no longer just focused on traditional French pastries, but are experimenting with new combinations and flavors. The success of the Cronut and other hybrid pastries has also led to a renewed interest in the art of pastry-making, with many bakers and chefs looking to create their own innovative offerings.\n\nOverall, the world of pastry is undergoing a significant transformation, with a focus on innovation, creativity, and experimentation.

Monis, who was on bail for multiple charges, including being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife and over 50 sexual and indecent assault charges, took 17 hostages on Monday morning. The siege ended in a violent confrontation with police, resulting in the deaths of Monis and two hostages, Tori Johnson, the cafe manager, and Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old lawyer.\n\n**Background on Man Haron Monis**\n\nMonis, who was granted asylum in Australia in 2001, had a history of violent and extremist behavior. He was convicted of sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan and was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. He also faced multiple charges of sexual and indecent assault, and was accused of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal. Monis had been on bail for these charges and had recently lost a bid to have his conviction overturned in the High Court.\n\n**Siege Details**\n\nThe siege began on Monday morning when Monis entered the Lindt Chocolat Cafe and took 17 hostages. Police negotiated with Monis for 16 hours before storming the cafe at 2:00am on Tuesday. Five hostages managed to escape on Monday afternoon, and several more escaped early on Tuesday as commandos stormed the cafe. The remaining hostages were rescued, but Monis and two hostages were killed in the confrontation.\n\n**Investigation and Aftermath**\n\nAn investigation into the siege is underway, with police examining Monis' motives and how he obtained a gun. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has questioned why Monis was not on the country's terror watch list, and has promised to examine the government's handling of the situation. The Australian National Imams Council has issued a statement condemning the attack and offering condolences to the families of the victims.\n\n**Tributes and Condolences**\n\nA sea of flowers has been laid in memory of the victims in Martin Place, and a church service was held at Sydney's St Mary Cathedral to mourn the victims.

The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell.

The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service.

Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "length": 0}

Despite a $140 million budget, the film earned only $18.6 million in its North American debut over the July 4th weekend, ranking fourth place. The film's performance is considered a flop, especially considering its high production costs and the fact that it was expected to be a major family film.\n\nThe film, based on Roald Dahl's beloved children's book, follows the story of a young girl named Sophie who befriends a giant named the BFG. While the film received positive reviews from critics, with a 71% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it failed to resonate with audiences. The film's lackluster performance can be attributed to several factors, including its confusing title, lack of recognizable faces, and steep production costs.\n\nThe film's marketing campaign failed to generate excitement, with the trailers not showcasing the emotional bond between the BFG and Sophie, which is the film's core. The film's visuals, while grandiose, failed to live up to the expectations of audiences who were drawn to the film's fantasy elements. The film's failure to appeal to both children and adults is also a contributing factor to its poor performance.\n\nThe film's box office performance is a rare misstep for Spielberg, who has a proven track record of success. However, it is not the first time he has faced a box office disappointment, with his 1979 film \"1941\" being considered one of his biggest flops. The film's failure is also a reflection of the changing landscape of the film industry, where Pixar and Disney's fairy-tale adaptations have become the norm.\n\nThe film's performance will rely heavily on its international box office, where it has opened in only two territories so far. If it fails to perform well overseas, it will be considered a significant loss for Disney, Amblin Entertainment, and Walden Media. The film's failure is a reminder that even the most experienced and successful filmmakers can face setbacks, and that the film industry is constantly evolving.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The BFG\" is a disappointing box office performance for Steven Spielberg, but it is not a reflection of his talent or abilities as a filmmaker.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes.

His speech will likely call for boosted sanctions against Iran, but Obama has suggested he would veto any bill giving Congress a chance to legislate on the matter. This weekend, Netanyahu offered conciliatory words, saying he \"respected\" Obama and that \"strength will prevail over differences of opinion.\" Obama will meet Reuters for an interview this afternoon, while National Security Adviser Susan Rice and UN Ambassador Samantha Power speak to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a group Netanyahu will also address, the Times reports. The paper sees the meetings as a chance for the administration to reaffirm its support for Israel. Indeed, John Kerry yesterday noted on ABC's This Week that Netanyahu \"is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously. And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history,\" Reuters reports. Kerry tomorrow will join international officials in Switzerland as they look to outline an Iranian deal by the month's end, the Washington Post reports.

These women, often desperate for money, are forced to engage in this work to survive, with some earning as little as $3 per day. The women are often held prisoner by pimps and are unable to refuse the work.\n\nIn one case, a 30-year-old woman named Suh fled North Korea in 2008 and was forced to engage in online sex work to support her family. She earned $120 in her best week, but eventually decided to leave the work and attempt to escape to the US with her 18-month-old daughter.

The study, conducted by an international team of ice experts, used 24 different methods to analyze ice loss, including satellite data, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations.\n\nThe researchers found that the ice sheet in West Antarctica, which accounts for most of the melting, is in a state of collapse. The study estimates that the continent has lost nearly 84 billion tons of ice per year from 1992 to 2011, and this rate increased to over 241 billion tons per year from 2012 to 2017. The team warns that if the current trend continues, Antarctica alone could contribute about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century.\n\nThe study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd, attributes the melting to warmer ocean waters, which are nibbling at the floating edges of ice sheets from below. The warming of the southern ocean is connected to shifting winds, which are linked to global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels.

The stone, which is about the size of an egg, is described as a smooth, brown rock with lighter brown swirls. The church has also released a new book containing photos of the stone and the printer's manuscript of the Book of Mormon.\n\nThe release of the photos and the book is part of the church's effort to be more transparent and to provide accurate information about its history and practices. The church has been releasing books containing historical documents and articles that explain or clarify sensitive parts of its history, such as its past ban on black men in the lay clergy and its early history of polygamy.\n\nThe church's historian, Steven E. Snow, said that the Internet has brought both challenges and opportunities for the church, and that it is grateful for the opportunity to share its collection through the use of the Internet. Terryl Givens, a professor of literature and religion, said that the church's efforts to be more transparent are aimed at preventing current members from leaving and showing non-Mormons that the faith has nothing to hide.\n\nThe Book of Mormon was translated by Joseph Smith in a series of miraculous events that took place over a period of three months in 1829. Smith used a seer stone and the Urim and Thummim, a pair of stones bound together with a metal rim, to translate the text. The original manuscript of the Book of Mormon has survived, and it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript.\n\nThe translation process was a monumental task, and God prepared additional practical help in the form of physical instruments to aid in the process. Joseph Smith's scribes, including Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, and Emma Smith, played a crucial role in the translation process. They worked tirelessly to record the words of Joseph Smith, who dictated the text from another language.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has been translated into over 110 languages and has been distributed to over 168 million people since its publication in 1830.

The dispute began when Corker, the retiring chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed concerns about Trump's stability and competence, stating that he was putting the country on the path to World War III. Trump responded by calling Corker \"Liddle' Bob\" and accusing him of being a \"negative voice\" who was \"largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal.\"\n\nCorker had previously praised Trump during the 2016 campaign, but has since become a vocal critic of the president's behavior and policies. In a New York Times interview, Corker said that Trump was acting \"like he's doing 'The Apprentice' or something\" and that he was trying to contain the president's worst instincts. Trump has denied Corker's claims, saying that he had asked him to reconsider his decision not to run for re-election and that he would have endorsed him.\n\nThe feud has highlighted the fraying relations between Trump and congressional Republicans, who are struggling to pass legislation and maintain their majorities in Congress. Trump has yet to score a signature legislative victory, and his party is facing a tough election year with 25 Democratic Senate seats up for grabs. The president's base is also growing increasingly frustrated with the party's inability to deliver on its promises.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, has announced plans to support as many as 15 Republican Senate candidates in 2018, including challengers to incumbents like Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Dean Heller (R-NV). Bannon's move is seen as an attempt to shake up the party and push it further to the right.\n\nThe feud between Trump and Corker has also raised questions about the role of the press in holding the president accountable. Reporters have been criticized for not pushing back harder against Trump's claims and for not asking tougher questions. However, some have argued that the press has a responsibility to keep confidences and not to sensationalize or distort the truth.\n\nAs the election season heats up, the feud between Trump and Corker is likely to continue, with both leaders trading blows on Twitter and in public statements.

It's not clear what Trump meant in saying that the newspaper set up Corker, but the transcript makes clear that Corker knew he was on the record, notes CNN. He also knew the call was being recorded, telling the reporter that his staff was recording it, \"and I hope you are, too.\" GOP trouble: At the National Journal, political analyst Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report writes that Trump went to a \"darker place\" in his Corker criticism, and he now thinks the GOP majority is in jeopardy not only in the Senate but in the House. \"The party needs to sublimate its divisions, get mainstream Republicans to the polls, and persuade the Trump base to cast ballot for non-Trump Republicans,\" he writes. \"That's a tall order.

The Sherpas, who are employed by foreign-owned guiding companies, are at a higher risk of death on the mountain due to their exposure to the most hazardous terrain, lack of access to bottled oxygen, and limited medical care.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage among the Sherpas, who have announced a strike unless the Nepali government meets their demands, including increased compensation for families of deceased Sherpas, better insurance benefits, and a permanent relief fund.

Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."], "length": 0}

The study, published in the journal PLoS One, found that people can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men by viewing their faces in photographs, but not women. The researchers used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape.\n\nThe study found that faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are longer, with a wider distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. On the other hand, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that these facial characteristics were only associated with perceived intelligence and not actual IQ scores. The study also found that the correlation between these facial traits and perceived attractiveness suggests that there is an intelligence stereotype, but these morphological traits do not correlate with real intelligence.\n\nThe researchers proposed several explanations for why people can predict men's intelligence based on their face, but not women's intelligence. One possible explanation is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces. Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness, which may prevent an accurate assessment of their intelligence.\n\nThe study also found that people who are perceived as more attractive are also perceived as more intelligent, but this link is stronger for women's faces than men's faces. The researchers suggested that this may be due to the fact that women are judged more on their attractiveness than men.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for our understanding of how we perceive intelligence and how it is associated with facial characteristics. The researchers concluded that the ability to accurately assess intelligence from facial photographs is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural stereotypes and individual differences in perception.\n\nOverall, the study suggests that while we may be able to make some educated guesses about a person's intelligence based on their face, these guesses are not always accurate and are influenced by a variety of biases and cultural stereotypes.", "answers": ["It's easier to guess men's intelligence than women's just by looking at their faces\u2014maybe because we're so distracted by female beauty, according to a new study.

The discovery was made by Mike Brown, a renowned astronomer at Caltech, and his co-author Konstantin Batygin. According to their research, published in the Astronomical Journal, Planet Nine is estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun at an average distance of 20 times farther than Neptune. The planet's existence was inferred from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, which appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet.\n\nBrown, who is often referred to as the \"Pluto killer\" due to his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006, believes that Planet Nine is a significant discovery that could rewrite the textbooks on our solar system. He and Batygin initially set out to disprove the existence of a hidden planet, but their research revealed that the gravitational effects of a massive perturber were the most plausible explanation for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked excitement among astronomers, with some estimating that the odds of its existence are as high as 90%. However, others have cautioned that the evidence is still circumstantial and that further observations and detections of perturbed bodies are needed to confirm the hypothesis.\n\nBrown's discovery of Planet Nine has also reignited the debate over Pluto's status as a planet.

However, these efforts have only served to further restrict movement and create a sense of siege.\n\nThe rebels, led by the Free Syrian Army, are making gains in the suburbs surrounding Damascus, with the ultimate goal of strangling the government's stronghold.

The spacecraft, launched in 2006, has traveled over 3 billion miles to reach the dwarf planet, which was once considered the ninth planet in our solar system but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\n**New Discoveries and Insights**\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft has already delivered data that is \"a gift for the ages,\" according to principal investigator Alan Stern. The data reveals that Pluto is larger than previously thought, with a diameter of approximately 1,473 miles. This new measurement, combined with precise measurements of Pluto's mass, suggests that the dwarf planet contains more ice and less rock than previously estimated.\n\nThe spacecraft has also captured stunning images of Pluto's surface, which show a diverse range of features, including vast expanses of small, tightly packed dimple-like formations. These features are similar to those found on Neptune's moon Triton, suggesting that Pluto's surface may be relatively young, with some areas potentially being resurfaced in the recent past.\n\n**The Flyby and Data Transmission**\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft will fly by Pluto at 7:49 a.m. EDT on July 14, and the first high-resolution images will be released on Wednesday afternoon. The spacecraft will take hundreds of observations of Pluto and its five moons, including Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. The data will be transmitted back to Earth over the next 16 months, with each piece of data taking about 4.5 hours to transmit.\n\n**The Mission's Significance**\n\nThe New Horizons mission marks the end of the US space agency's bid to explore every planet in our solar system, starting with Venus in 1962. The mission will provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system, as well as the composition and geology of Pluto and its moons.\n\n**Tracking the Mission**\n\nThe Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex in Australia will be the first place in the world to receive close-up images of Pluto, with the data being relayed back to the tracking station. The spacecraft will travel at 58,000 km/h past Pluto, and there is a small possibility that it could be lost if it encounters any space debris.\n\n**Future Plans**\n\nAfter the flyby,", "answers": ["This is one of the biggest days in the exploration of our solar system since Voyager 2 approached Neptune in 1989\u2014and there may not be a day like it again.

The confirmation will mark the completion of NASA's tour of the \"classical nine\" planets, reports the AP, which notes that Pluto was considered a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf one when the probe began its journey in 2006. Some things to know about the historic flyby, which comes 50 years to the day after the first successful flyby of Mars: New Horizons will have to capture a vast amount of data in a short time. The probe will be pushed to its limits as it pivots to capture photos and information on Pluto and its moons Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra during the flyby. \"I can't wait to get into the data and really start making sense of it. Right now, we're just standing under the waterfall and enjoying it,\" principal New Horizons scientist Alan Stern tells the BBC. We don't know whether it was a success. The probe is far too busy to \"phone home,\" the AP notes, but it's expected to send a confirmation signal at around 9pm tonight. The eagerly awaited first photos from the flyby should be released tomorrow night, the Guardian reports, though it will take 16 months to send all the data from the flyby back to Earth. We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done. New Horizons will keep traveling into the Kuiper Belt debris field and beyond after it passes Pluto, National Geographic notes, and it may have more research to do if NASA approves funding.

The investigation into the disappearance has been ongoing for over a week, with various theories emerging about the possible cause of the plane's disappearance.\n\n**Pilot Suicide Theory**\n\nOne of the theories being considered is that one of the pilots, possibly Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Ab Hamid, deliberately crashed the plane. This theory is based on the fact that the plane's communications equipment was switched off and the plane made a sharp, deliberate turn after it last communicated with air traffic controllers. Mike Glynn, a committee member of the Australian and International Pilots Association, believes that pilot suicide is the most likely explanation for the plane's disappearance.\n\n**Investigation and Search Efforts**\n\nThe investigation into the disappearance of Flight 370 has been led by Malaysian authorities, with assistance from international partners. The search area has been expanded to cover 11 countries, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The search efforts have been suspended temporarily due to a lack of new leads, but are expected to resume once fresh search areas are identified.\n\n**Radar and Satellite Data**\n\nRadar and satellite data suggest that the plane flew for over seven hours after its last communication with air traffic controllers, and may have flown as far as the Indian Ocean. The plane's last communication was made in one of two possible traffic corridors, a northern arc stretching from Kazakhstan to northern Thailand, and a southern arc spanning from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\n**Background Checks and Passenger Investigation**\n\nBackground checks on passengers have been completed, with no red flags found. However, investigators are still looking into the backgrounds of the pilots and passengers to determine if any of them had flight training or connections to terror groups. One passenger, an aviation engineer, was on his way to Beijing to work for a private-jet company.\n\n**International Cooperation**\n\nInternational cooperation has been crucial in the investigation and search efforts. China has sent technical experts to join the investigation, and two Chinese search vessels have headed for the Strait of Malacca. India has suspended its search operations until fresh search areas are identified, but has not ruled out the possibility of resuming", "answers": ["The echo chamber that is the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has yet to yield much in the way of definites, but the focus continues to remain on the pilots and the theory that the jet's disappearance was not an accident or mechanical failure.

The new measurements indicate that the universe is expanding at a rate of 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which is 5-9% higher than the previously estimated rate. This discrepancy has sparked a new wave of interest in the mysterious components of the universe, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, which make up 95% of the universe but do not emit light.\n\nThe study, led by Nobel laureate Adam Riess, used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The researchers used a new method to calculate the distances, which involved measuring the brightness of Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. The new measurements have a margin of error of just 2.4%, making them the most accurate ever.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. The faster expansion rate suggests that the universe may be accelerating at a greater rate than previously thought, which could be due to dark energy or other unknown forces. This could also mean that Einstein's theory of general relativity is incomplete or inaccurate.\n\nOther possible explanations for the discrepancy include the presence of unknown subatomic particles, such as neutrinos, that travel at nearly the speed of light, or the possibility that dark matter has some unexpected characteristics. The study's findings have sparked a new era of research into the mysteries of the universe, and scientists are eager to continue studying the phenomenon to gain a deeper understanding of the cosmos.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope has been instrumental in making these discoveries, and scientists are continuing to use it to refine their measurements and reduce the uncertainty in the Hubble constant. Future telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope, will also play a crucial role in furthering our understanding of the universe's expansion.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the universe's fate. The faster expansion rate means that the distance between galaxies will double in about 9.8 billion years, and the universe may eventually become too vast for us to observe. However, the study's lead author, Adam Riess, notes that the discovery is an exciting reminder of the mysteries that still remain to be uncovered in the universe, and scientists are eager to continue exploring the phenomenon to gain a deeper understanding of the cosmos.", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought.

For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency.

He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, over the leaks.\n\nSnowden's revelations have sparked a heated debate about the U.S. government's collection of records of domestic telephone calls and overseas Internet activity in the global hunt for terrorists and criminals.

Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Rep. Mike Rogers, have defended the surveillance programs, pointing to their successes in disrupting plots and preventing terrorist attacks.\n\nSnowden's choice of Hong Kong as a haven for leaking intelligence documents and unmasking himself as a whistleblower was based on calculations about the territory's press freedom safeguards and its extradition treaty with the US.

The seven prisoners released by the US were not just \"civilians\" as portrayed by the Obama administration, but were actually accused of posing threats to national security, including being part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with US-made microelectronics for surface-to-air and cruise missiles.\n\nThe investigation also found that the US dropped charges and international arrest warrants against 14 other Iranian fugitives, including some who were accused of conspiring to supply Iran with satellite technology and hardware, and others who were involved in a procurement network providing Iran with high-tech components for IEDs used to kill American troops in Iraq. The administration did not disclose the names or charges against these individuals, citing that extradition requests were unlikely to be successful.\n\nThe investigation suggests that the Obama administration was aware of the severity of the charges against the released prisoners and the fugitives, but chose to downplay them in order to secure the deal.

Hanson gave Cipriani $2.5 million in cash, which Cipriani was supposed to gamble with and then return to Hanson in the form of a casino check. However, Cipriani lost the money, and Hanson became angry and began to threaten him and his wife.\n\nThe threats escalated, with Hanson sending Cipriani a DVD containing footage of two men being beheaded, as well as a message warning Cipriani that he would suffer the same fate if he didn't pay back the money. Cipriani eventually contacted the FBI, and an investigation was launched into Hanson's operation. Hanson was arrested in 2015 and eventually pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to distribute drugs.\n\nCipriani's association with Hanson has resulted in a lifetime ban from the casinos that once sent private jets for him, and he has been forced to reinvent himself as a freelance source for the FBI.

His fall from grace is a wild tale: While at USC in 2004, Hanson began selling drugs, including cocaine and steroids, Rolling Stone previously reported. After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy. Cipriani says Hanson threatened him and his wife, including by sending them a video of two men being beheaded. \"If you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you,\" an attached note read, according to prosecutors.

Using a brain-reading device that detects patterns in brain activity, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were able to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions, and even express their happiness with life.\n\nThe study, led by neuroscientist Niels Birbaumer, involved four patients, aged 24 to 76, who were trained to use the system over a year after they were diagnosed with completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS). The device uses infrared light to spot variations in blood flow in different regions of the brain, allowing the computer to distinguish between \"yes\" and \"no\" responses.\n\nThe patients were asked a series of simple questions, such as \"Your husband's name is Joachim\" and \"Berlin is the capital of France,\" and were able to answer with a high degree of accuracy. When they scored at least 70% on the training questions, the doctors moved on to more personal questions, including those about quality of life. To the surprise of the researchers, all four patients indicated that they were \"happy\" with life, suggesting that locked-in syndrome may not be the living hell many presume it to be.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the treatment and care of patients with CLIS. While the condition is often associated with a poor quality of life, the patients in this study reported a good quality of life, even matching that of healthy people of the same age. The reasons for this are unclear, but Birbaumer suggests that patients may become focused on the good social interactions around them and even experience a state of meditation due to their inability to feel or move their bodies.\n\nThe researchers are now working on building a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions. This could potentially enable patients to express their thoughts and feelings in a more meaningful way, and could have a significant impact on their quality of life.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked interest in the potential use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to communicate with other kinds of brain-injured patients, including those who are presumed to be in a vegetative state. If replicated in a larger group of patients, the findings suggest that fNIRS may be a reliable means of communication for these patients.\n\nOverall, the study's breakthrough in communication with completely locked-in patients has the potential to transform the lives of those affected", "answers": ["Four paralyzed patients unable to communicate for years were finally able to do so through a potentially groundbreaking brain-reading system.

Researchers at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology.

The latter group includes the departments of Energy, Labor, and Transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the cuts would lead to job losses, Reuters reports. \"You can\u2019t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it,\" he said during a budget preview Wednesday.

Over a dozen women have come forward, accusing Cosby of drugging and assaulting them in various locations, including his home, hotel rooms, and backstage areas. The allegations span several decades, from the 1960s to the 2000s, and involve women of different ages and backgrounds.\n\n**Early Years: Cosby's Rise to Fame**\n\nIn the 1960s, Cosby was a rising star in the entertainment industry, known for his comedy and charm. He was a regular at the Playboy Mansion and was friends with Hugh Hefner. Cosby's career took off with the hit TV show \"I Spy,\" which made him the first black actor to win an Emmy for a leading role in a television series.\n\n**Allegations of Abuse**\n\nSeveral women have come forward with allegations of abuse, including:\n\n*   Joan Tarshis, a 19-year-old comedy writer who claims Cosby drugged and raped her in 1969.\n*   Linda Traitz, a waitress who claims Cosby offered her a ride home and then drugged and assaulted her in 1969.\n*   Tamara Green, a model who claims Cosby drugged and assaulted her in the early 1970s.\n*   Barbara Bowman, a 13-year-old actress who claims Cosby offered her a role in a TV show and then drugged and assaulted her in 1984.\n*   Andrea Constand, a Temple University employee who claims Cosby drugged and assaulted her in 2004.\n\n**Fallout and Response**\n\nCosby's team has denied the allegations, with his attorney, Martin Singer, calling them \"absurd\" and \"ridiculous.\" However, many of the women who have come forward have corroborated each other's stories, and some have provided evidence to support their claims.\n\n**Impact on Cosby's Career**\n\nThe scandal has had a significant impact on Cosby's career, with several projects being canceled or postponed. Netflix has postponed an upcoming comedy special, and NBC has canceled a planned sitcom. TV Land has also removed \"The Cosby Show\" reruns from its network.\n\n**Support for Cosby**\n\nDespite the allegations, some people have come to Cosby's defense, including his wife, Camille, and a few of his friends. However, many others have condemned his behavior and called for him to be held accountable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Bill Cosby scandal", "answers": ["Details of alleged sexual assaults by Bill Cosby just keep on coming.

Victoria Valentino\u2014an ex-Playboy Playmate speaking up for the first time\u2014says he drugged her and a friend with red pills in 1970. Then he \"opened his fly and grabbed my head and pushed my head down. And then he turned me over. It was like a waking nightmare.\" But she never pressed charges: \"What kind of credibility did I have?\" Denials by Cosby lawyers pepper the article, as do quotes from a friend, a writer, and a district attorney who say they heard the women's accusations years ago. The Post also looks at Cosby's marriage to Camille Cosby, saying \"it\u2019s unclear how much Camille knew about her husband\u2019s activities\" since six of the alleged sexual assaults occurred at his house. She was reportedly aware of his \"selfish\" behavior in Los Angeles, which contrasted with his upstanding life on the East Coast as a man studying for a PhD and sitting on a board at Temple University. Yet even there, a Temple employee accuses him of drugging her with blue pills and sexually assaulting her. In other Cosby news: Ex-NBC employee Frank Scotti tells the Daily News that during the Cosby Show's heyday, he guarded Cosby's dressing-room door while the comedy star hosted young models. Scotti says he then paid off the women with money orders using cash provided by Cosby (he produces the money orders). \"He had everybody fooled,\" says Scotti. \"Nobody suspected.\" When Cosby appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman, he asked female staffers to do an odd thing: watch him eat curry, Gawker reports.

A citizen's complaint filed against New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has been allowed to proceed, meaning he could face criminal charges for his alleged failure to stop the lane closures.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe lane closures, which took place in September 2013, caused significant traffic problems in Fort Lee and sparked a 16-month investigation. Two former members of Christie's inner circle, Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, are currently on trial in federal court in Newark for their roles in the scandal.\n\n**Citizen's Complaint**\n\nThe complaint, filed by William Brennan, a retired Teaneck firefighter and citizen activist, alleges that Christie knew about the lane closures while they were happening and failed to stop them. Brennan claims that Christie's inaction constitutes second-degree official misconduct, a charge punishable by five to 10 years in prison.\n\n**Judge's Ruling**\n\nOn Thursday, a Hackensack municipal judge allowed Brennan's complaint to proceed, forwarding it to Bergen County Prosecutor Gurbir S. Grewal, who will decide whether to charge Christie. However, Grewal is a Christie appointee and may recuse himself in favor of an independent prosecutor.\n\n**Federal Trial**\n\nIn the federal trial, the government rested its case after 15 days and 18 witnesses. The government's final witness was FBI agent Michelle Pickels, who testified that she was unable to recover some of Kelly's emails, including the infamous \"time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\" from Kelly's Yahoo account, suggesting they were deleted.\n\n**Defense**\n\nBaroni's defense team began presenting its case, with Christie's former general counsel Charlie McKenna testifying that he believed the lane closures were part of a traffic study until emails suggesting otherwise emerged in January 2014. McKenna claimed that he didn't find it odd that New Jersey residents were kept in the dark about the lane closures because it was all done for the sake of science.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe Bridgegate scandal has had a significant impact on Christie's career, with many experts arguing that it contributed to his failed bid for the Republican nomination for President. The scandal has also led to calls for Christie's resignation and has damaged his reputation.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nThe case will now proceed to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, where Grewal will decide whether to charge Christie.

Per Brennan's complaint, Christie knew lane closures were happening and could have put a stop to the whole thing. The complaint is based on testimony from the trial against former Christie aide Bridget Anne Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni. During the trial, a man Christie appointed to Port Authority testified that both he and Baroni told Christie about the lane closures during a 9/11 ceremony (the lanes were closed from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13, 2013). Now that the judge has ruled the complaint can move forward, it will go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office so a decision can be made as to whether Christie should be indicted. Christie's office, which insists the governor had no knowledge of the lane closures while they were ongoing, said it would appeal the judge's ruling.

And Clinton isn't helping herself. \"When she says she and Bill were broke when they left the White House; when she sets her own email rules and says it was only for her own convenience; when she hangs out with the Davos, Wall Street, or Hollywood crowds, she makes herself a more inviting target.\" Meanwhile, statistician Nate Silver acknowledges that Clinton is \"very likely to become the Democratic nominee.\" As for the general election, he writes at FiveThirtyEight, it could go either way. Silver questions the so-called \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" that plays a role in Chait's thinking. Right now, Clinton's favorability ratings are \"break-even,\" and she's \"so well-known \u2026 that it\u2019s almost as if voters are dispensing with all the formalities and evaluating her as they might when she\u2019s on the ballot next November.

She was 22 and had just started her job as a firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service. Myers said she was shocked and upset but didn't stop her supervisor, fearing retaliation.

The unmasked names were then sent to top officials, including those at the National Security Council, the Defense Department, and the CIA.\n\nThe unmasking was part of incidental electronic surveillance of candidate and President-elect Trump and those close to him.

A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials.

The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts.

The vote, scheduled for Sunday, is a result of a long-standing crisis that has been brewing since the mid-1990s. Greece's economy has been plagued by chronic deficit spending, which led to a massive debt burden that has been unsustainable since 2009. The country has received two bailouts, in 2010 and 2012, but the measures implemented to address the crisis have failed to deliver the desired results.\n\nThe current crisis began in May 2010, when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conducted an analysis that concluded that Greece could close its deficits and grow its economy if it undertook drastic reforms. However, the reforms were not implemented, and the economy contracted, making the debt burden even more unsustainable.\n\nThe IMF loan that was due on June 29 was a critical moment in the crisis. Greece defaulted on the loan, and the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to stop accepting additional collateral from Greek banks, effectively cutting off their access to credit. The ECB's decision led to the closure of Greek banks, and the government imposed limits on cash withdrawals to prevent a run on the banks.\n\nThe Greek government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, is asking for debt relief and a more favorable bailout deal. However, the creditors, including the IMF, the ECB, and the European Commission, are refusing to budge, citing concerns that a debt write-off would set a precedent for other countries in the eurozone.\n\nTsipras has called on voters to reject the creditors' proposal and vote \"no\" in the referendum. He argues that a \"no\" vote will strengthen his hand in negotiations and allow him to secure a better deal. However, the creditors have warned that a \"no\" vote will lead to a sharp recession and potentially even a Greek exit from the eurozone.\n\nThe outcome of the referendum is uncertain, with polls showing a dead heat between the \"yes\" and \"no\" camps. The question on the ballot paper is complex, and many voters are unclear about what they are voting for. The vote is not just about the bailout deal, but also about Greece's future in the eurozone and its economic prospects.\n\nThe consequences of a \"no\" vote are severe, with the potential for a sharp recession, a collapse in tax revenues, and a possible exit from the eurozone.

The practice was based on a revelation from God, which stated that marriage could last beyond death and that eternal marriage was essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children. The revelation also taught that plural marriage was a commandment of God, given to some of His people in biblical times, including Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was introduced among the early Saints incrementally, and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential. The first plural marriage in Nauvoo took place in 1841, when Louisa Beaman and Joseph Smith were sealed. Joseph married many additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The practice spread slowly, and by 1844, approximately 29 men and 50 women had entered into plural marriage.\n\nPlural marriage was a trial of faith for many who practiced it, and it was met with controversy and opposition. However, for those who accepted the practice, it was a redemptive process of sacrifice and spiritual refinement. Many participants in plural marriage reported experiencing a spiritual witness of its truthfulness, which allowed them to accept the principle.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not without its challenges. Joseph Smith's wife, Emma, was opposed to the practice and struggled with it throughout her life. However, she eventually accepted four of Joseph's plural marriages and accepted the wives into her household.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints officially discontinued the practice of plural marriage in 1890, after the U.S. government passed laws against it. The Church's president, Wilford Woodruff, issued a statement known as the Manifesto, which declared the Church's intention to submit to the laws of the United States and to discontinue the practice of plural marriage.\n\nToday, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints no longer practices plural marriage. However, the Church permits a man whose wife has died to be sealed to another woman when he remarries, and members are permitted to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased men and women who married more than once on earth, sealing them to all of the spouses to whom they were legally married.\n\nThe legacy of plural marriage continues to be felt in the Church today, with many members tracing their ancestry back to", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy?

The study, conducted by researchers Michael Kasumovic and Jeffrey Kuznekoff, analyzed data from 163 plays of the video game Halo 3 and found that men who are less skilled at the game and performing poorly are more likely to make nasty comments to female gamers.\n\nThe study suggests that this behavior is not unique to the gaming community, but rather a reflection of a broader societal issue. According to a Pew report, 40% of Internet users have personally experienced harassment, with women being particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and stalking.\n\nThe researchers argue that this behavior can be explained by an evolutionary perspective, which suggests that men who are lower in status and performing poorly are more likely to feel threatened by the presence of a female competitor and respond with hostility. In contrast, higher-skilled men are more likely to be supportive and positive towards female gamers.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for understanding online harassment and sexism, and suggest that teaching young men that losing to women is not socially debilitating may be a way to counteract this behavior. The researchers also note that video games offer a unique opportunity to examine variation in sexist behaviors and the situations that result in changes in sexist attitudes.\n\nThe study's results are supported by a separate study published in PLOS ONE, which examined the behavior of male players in an online first-person shooter game. The study found that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly, while higher-skilled players were more positive and supportive.\n\nOverall, the studies suggest that online harassment and sexism are complex issues that require a nuanced understanding of the underlying factors that contribute to them.

A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

In 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Ingraham v. Wright that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment does not apply to disciplinary corporal punishment in public schools. The court held that the Eighth Amendment was designed to protect those convicted of crimes, and that the use of corporal punishment in schools is a matter of state law and not a federal constitutional issue.\n\nHowever, the court also ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does require that the use of corporal punishment in schools be reasonable and not excessive. The court held that the common law privilege permitting teachers to inflict reasonable corporal punishment on children in their care is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.\n\nDespite this ruling, corporal punishment remains a common practice in some public schools, particularly in the state of Alabama. According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, nearly 19,000 students were paddled in Alabama public schools in the 2013-2014 school year. This is one of the highest rates of corporal punishment in the country, with boys being paddled at a rate of 4.5 to 1 over girls.\n\nThe use of corporal punishment in schools has been criticized by many experts and advocacy groups, who argue that it is an ineffective and potentially harmful practice. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents be encouraged and assisted in the development of methods other than spanking for managing undesired behavior. The American Psychological Association has also opposed the use of corporal punishment in schools, citing research that shows it can have negative effects on children's self-esteem and behavior.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a trend towards reducing the use of corporal punishment in Alabama schools.

The results show that while the number of high school seniors who reported smoking tobacco in the past 30 days has largely plateaued, the rate of teenagers using nicotine - either through tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes - is on the rise.\n\nThe study found that in 2014, about 14% of Southern California high school seniors said they had smoked or vaped in the last 30 days, which is similar to the 19% rate seen in 1995. This suggests that e-cigarettes are enticing an entirely new group of teenagers to use nicotine, rather than simply replacing traditional tobacco products.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Pediatrics also found that e-cigarette use among adolescents is a gateway to traditional tobacco products.

E-cigarettes work by heating a liquid that may or may not contain nicotine, producing a vapor that is inhaled. While e-cigarettes may be safer than traditional tobacco products, they are not risk-free, and nicotine can be highly addictive, particularly in a developing brain.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that cigarette smoking kills more than 480,000 Americans annually, making it the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States.

He stated that he had four contacts with Russians during the campaign and transition, but none of them were impactful or memorable.\n\nKushner's statement was met with skepticism by lawmakers and experts, who pointed out that his account of certain meetings differed from previous reports and raised new questions. For example, Kushner claimed that he had only one meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign, but a previous report suggested that he had two calls with Kislyak between April and November 2016. Kushner denied the calls, but his phone records do not support his claim.\n\nKushner also disputed a report that he had sought to establish a secret backchannel with Russia during the transition period. He claimed that he had asked Kislyak if he could use a secure line at the Russian embassy to receive information about the Syrian conflict, but Kislyak said it was not possible.\n\nKushner's statement also raised questions about his meeting with Sergey Gorkov, a Russian banker and friend of President Vladimir Putin. Kushner claimed that the meeting was a social encounter and that he had no business dealings with Gorkov.

In recent years, lawsuits against fraternities have become more common, with over 60 people dying in incidents linked to fraternities since 2005.\n\nThe North-American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) has been a major force in opposing efforts to restrict fraternity recruitment, arguing that it infringes on students' right to freedom of association.

That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist?

Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Center and American University have found that mustached bats use the left and right sides of their brains to process different aspects of sounds, similar to humans. This hemispheric specialization is characterized by the left brain being better at processing fast sounds and the right brain processing slow ones.\n\n**Mustached Bats**\n\nThe study, published in Frontiers of Neuroscience, reveals that mustached bats use their left brain to process fast sounds, which is essential for distinguishing communication sounds from each other. The right brain, on the other hand, is used for processing slow sounds, which is necessary for using sonar to track the velocity of fast-moving insects. This asymmetric sampling in bats is sex-dependent, with males having more asymmetry than females.\n\n**Humans**\n\nSimilar to mustached bats, humans also exhibit hemispheric specialization in sound processing. The left brain is better at processing fast sounds, which is essential for language processing, while the right brain processes slow sounds, which is important for identifying who is speaking, gauging their emotional state, and teasing out pitch in music.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for understanding certain human language disorders and potentially improving computer speech recognition. The study also opens a pathway to studying bat brains in order to understand human language disorders. However, the asymmetrical sound processing in bats makes in-depth scientific studies of certain communication disorders, such as aphasia, nearly impossible.\n\n**Evolutionary Significance**\n\nThe study's senior author, Stuart Washington, PhD, suggests that the hemispheric specialization in both humans and bats makes evolutionary sense.

This news comes as a surprise, as Snooki has been open about her desire to get married and have children, but her partying lifestyle may pose a challenge to her ability to provide for her child.\n\nThe news of Snooki's pregnancy has sparked concerns about the potential risks of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition that can occur when a mother drinks during pregnancy. FAS is a group of conditions that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure, and can cause a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems, including growth deficiency, facial abnormalities, and central nervous system damage.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FAS is the most severe form of FASD, and can occur in up to 9 per 1000 live births in the United States. The condition is caused by drinking more than four standard drinks per day during pregnancy, and can result in a range of problems, including microcephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and cerebellar hypoplasia.\n\nIn an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Snooki admitted to having a history of overdrinking and waking up in strange places, including a garbage can. She also confessed that she doesn't want to be a role model, suggesting that her partying lifestyle may not be suitable for her future child.\n\nThe news of Snooki's pregnancy has also raised questions about her ability to balance her career and motherhood. As a reality TV star, Snooki has built her fame on her partying lifestyle, but her pregnancy may force her to re-evaluate her priorities and consider a more responsible approach to her career.\n\nIn related news, the CDC estimates that 3 million women in the United States are at risk of having a baby with FASD, and recommends that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or planning a pregnancy. The only certain way to prevent FAS is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy, and the CDC recommends that women of childbearing age should be on birth control or abstain from drinking alcohol as the safest way to avoid this.\n\nOverall, the news of Snooki's pregnancy has sparked concerns about the potential risks of FAS and the challenges of balancing a partying lifestyle", "answers": ["Let's hope Snooki sorta planned that baby she's reportedly carrying (stop giggling).

The evidence suggests that Wright was involved in the development of Bitcoin and may have been the one who created it.  The clues include a blog post from August 2008 in which Wright mentions his intention to release a \"cryptocurrency paper,\" a post from November 2008 in which he requests that readers encrypt their messages to him using a PGP public key linked to Nakamoto, and a leaked email from June 2008 in which Wright imagines a \"P2P distributed ledger\" - a reference to Bitcoin's public record of transactions.\n\nWright's connection to Nakamoto is further supported by his ownership of a 1.1 million bitcoin blockchain worth $605 million, which is the same size as the mysterious bitcoin fortune attributed to Nakamoto.  Additionally, Wright's company, Tulip Trading, built two supercomputers that have ranked among the top 500 in the world, and he has been involved in several bitcoin-based research projects.\n\nHowever, some experts have raised questions about the authenticity of the evidence, suggesting that it could be an elaborate hoax orchestrated by Wright himself.

While scientists agree that climate change did not cause the storm, they note that warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the future.\n\n**Funding the Recovery**\n\nThe cost of recovery from the storm is expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars, and the issue of funding will test the nation's unity. In the past, Congress has faced partisan divides over funding for natural disasters, with some lawmakers demanding offsetting cuts in other programs. This approach has been criticized for undermining the core idea that government exists to help share risks that individuals and communities cannot reasonably bear alone.\n\n**Climate Change and Extreme Weather**\n\nClimate change is increasing the odds that storms will be more powerful and destructive. Scientists note that warmer oceans and air hold more moisture, leading to more intense precipitation events. While it is difficult to attribute any individual storm to climate change, the dominant scientific consensus is that climate change is a major factor in the increasing severity of disasters like Hurricane Harvey.\n\n**The Politics of Climate Change**\n\nThe discussion of climate change has been politicized, with some politicians and media outlets downplaying its role in the storm. Fox News, in particular, has been criticized for its coverage, with hosts accusing CNN of using the storm to advance a \"leftist agenda.\" However, experts note that climate change is a scientifically accepted fact, and its impact on extreme weather events is well-documented.\n\n**Adapting to Climate Change**\n\nAs the world grapples with the consequences of climate change, the issue of adaptation has become increasingly important. While adaptation can help mitigate the effects of climate change, it is not a substitute for mitigation. In the absence of radical mitigation, adaptation will become increasingly difficult and expensive, and may ultimately involve abandoning certain areas to rising sea levels and more frequent flooding.\n\n**A Changing Climate**\n\nThe world is experiencing a rapid change in its climate, with more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and floods. This change is having a profound impact on human societies, economies, and ecosystems. As the climate continues to change, it is essential that we take action to mitigate its effects and adapt to its consequences.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHurricane Harvey has highlighted the complex and multifaceted issue of climate change. While it is difficult to attribute any individual storm to climate change, the scientific consensus is clear: climate change is increasing", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change\u2014particularly when talking about a single weather event\u2014the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."], "length": 0}

Dozens of people, including seven European military observers, journalists, and pro-Ukraine activists, are being held hostage in makeshift jails in Slovyansk. The German government has decried the seizure of the observers and called for their immediate release.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine has been marked by deadly clashes between political opponents since the eruption of a revolution in November. The country has also seen several anti-Semitic attacks, including two stabbings and two attempts to torch synagogues.\n\nAs tensions rise, the international community is calling for calm and urging Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty. The situation remains volatile, and it is unclear how the crisis will unfold in the coming days.\n\n**Key Developments:**\n\n* Mayor of Kharkiv, Gennady Kernes, shot in the back and critically wounded in a suspected assassination attempt\n", "answers": ["Gennady Kernes, the mayor of the Eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, was shot in the back this morning, and doctors are currently performing emergency surgery and \"fighting for his life,\" city hall tells the AP. The circumstances of the shooting are unclear, though a Ukrainian report spotted by the Wall Street Journal said he was swimming in a local spring. Kernes was a staunch ally of ousted president Viktor Yanukovych, notes the BBC, and was accused of sending activists to Kiev to harass pro-Western protesters against him. When Yanukovych fled the country, Kernes briefly did too, before returning and declaring that he now supported a united Ukraine. Kharkiv has so far managed to fend off the pro-Russian separatists that have taken over many other Eastern Ukrainian cities. Kernes is also Jewish, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency points out, and was the target of anti-Semitic hate speech during his mayoral election. Meanwhile: Masked militants today seized the city hall building in yet another town\u2014Kostyantynivka, which lies between Slovyansk and Donetsk\u2014and raised a flag proclaiming it part of the \"Donestsk Republic.\" They also reportedly control the town's police station. The self-proclaimed mayor of Slovyansk held a press conference yesterday in which he paraded before the cameras a group of European military observers separatists had captured, declaring them \"prisoners of war.\" He accused them of being spies for NATO, and said he might exchange them for pro-Russian activists held by Kiev, CNN reports. The observers said they'd agreed to the press conferences so that their families could see them. Shortly after the appearance, the separatists released one of the observers for health reasons; the Swedish captive had been suffering from diabetes."], "length": 0}

The program, which has a long history of performing complex heart surgeries, has seen a decline in its performance over the years, with a significantly higher number of patient deaths and complications compared to other programs nationwide.\n\n**Poor Outcomes and High Mortality Rate**\n\nAccording to data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, the program's one-year survival rate for patients who received a new heart between 2014 and 2016 was only 85%, compared to 91.4% nationally. This means that twice as many patients died within a year as would have been expected, taking into account patient characteristics and illnesses.\n\n**Concerns Raised by Former Patients and Staff**\n\nSeveral former patients and staff members have come forward to express concerns about the program's performance and the quality of care provided. One patient's wife, Judy Kveton, received an anonymous letter in 2017 detailing the program's poor outcomes and concerns about the lead surgeon, Dr. Jeffrey Morgan. Other staff members have also raised concerns about Morgan's performance and the program's overall quality.\n\n**Lead Surgeon's Background and Controversies**\n\nDr. Morgan, who took over as surgical director of the heart transplant program in 2016, has a relatively limited background in heart surgery. He has been named in two malpractice lawsuits in Michigan, and some of his work in Detroit has been called into question. Despite these concerns, Morgan was chosen to lead the program at Baylor St. Luke's, where he has been involved in several high-profile cases, including the transplant of a patient who died after suffering a series of complications.\n\n**Patient's Family Speaks Out**\n\nThe family of Lee Lewis, a patient who underwent a heart transplant at Baylor St. Luke's in 2018, has spoken out about their experiences with the program. Lewis's wife, Jennifer, chronicled her husband's struggles on social media, detailing the complications he faced after the transplant, including a series of strokes and infections. The family has expressed frustration with the program's communication and the quality of care provided.\n\n**Hospital's Response**\n\nBaylor St. Luke's Medical Center has responded to the investigation by acknowledging the program's poor outcomes and stating that it has taken steps to address the issues. The hospital has also defended Dr. Morgan's performance", "answers": ["Baylor St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center is one of America's most storied hospitals when it comes to heart transplants. Or was. Though some of the first heart transplants took place at the Houston hospital, things have disintegrated to the point that it now \"has had some of the worst heart transplant outcomes in the country.\" So write Mike Hixenbaugh and Charles Ornstein in a story co-published by the Houston Chronicle and ProPublica. Their joint investigation found an elevated death and complication count for heart transplant patients there, whose one-year survival rate \"now ranks near the bottom nationally\" at 85% for those who got a new heart between mid-2014 and 2016; the national rate was 91.4%. Hixenbaugh and Ornstein add a face to those stats via the story of James \"Lee\" Lewis. Word came on Jan. 1, 2018, that St. Luke's had a heart for Lewis\u2014news that brought hope the 52-year-old would be able to walk his daughter down the aisle in June. But by March 23, he was dead, having never left the hospital. What happened in between is a series of missteps, starting with the Jan. 2 transplant. Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart. Then came strokes, infection in Lewis' bloodstream, and what the family says was another equipment mishap that left him brain-dead. Read the full story here."], "length": 0}
