The report, which took four years to complete and cost $40 million, details the CIA's use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists held in secret overseas prisons.\n\nThe CIA has been accused of monitoring Senate computers used by committee staff to prepare the report, which may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency. The monitoring has sparked a criminal referral to the Justice Department, which is investigating allegations of malfeasance at the CIA.\n\nSenator Mark Udall, a champion of government transparency, has urged President Obama to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the report.

These proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, allowing the fish to survive in temperatures as low as 29\u00b0F (\u22122\u00b0C). However, a recent study has revealed a paradoxical consequence of this adaptation: the AFPs also inhibit the melting of ice crystals, causing them to persist inside the fish's bodies even in warmer temperatures.\n\nResearchers have found that the AFPs prevent ice crystals from melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP), a phenomenon known as \"superheating.\" This means that even when the water temperature rises above the freezing point, the ice crystals inside the fish remain intact. In fact, the study found that ice crystals persisted inside live fish at temperatures more than 1\u00b0C above their eqFMP for at least 24 hours, and at a lower temperature for several days.\n\nThe researchers, led by Paul Cziko, a doctoral student at the University of Oregon, used a combination of laboratory experiments and field observations to study the behavior of AFPs in Antarctic notothenioid fish. They found that the ice crystals accumulated in the fish's spleens, and it is possible that the spleen is trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlights the complex and often counterintuitive nature of evolution. While the AFPs provide a vital adaptation for the fish to survive in the cold waters, they also come with a hidden cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of life in extreme environments and the trade-offs that come with adaptations to survive in such conditions.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the AFPs may not be as beneficial as previously thought, and that the long-term cost of having these proteins may be a question for further research. The study provides a fascinating example of how evolution can lead to unexpected consequences, and highlights the importance of considering the full range of effects of adaptations in complex systems.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

This decline has significant implications for the marine ecosystem, as sardines are a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has been urged to take action to protect the sardine population, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species.\n\nThe sardine population has been in decline since 2006, with a 72% drop in population since its last peak. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in over a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000. The decline has led to steep cuts in fishing quotas, but some environmental groups are calling for a complete halt to sardine fishing.\n\nScientists are unsure of the cause of the decline, but point to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines. However, the decline is also raising concerns about overfishing and the impact of fishing on the ecosystem.\n\nThe decline of sardines is having a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with many species, including sea lions, brown pelicans, and other predators, struggling to find food. In 2013, over 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups washed up on beaches, with research suggesting that the scarcity of sardines was a contributing factor.\n\nThe Pacific sardine is a boom-bust fish, with populations fluctuating wildly in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. However, the current decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. If the population does not recover soon, experts warn that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years.\n\nThe PFMC has been urged to take action to protect the sardine population, including setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species. Environmental groups are also calling for a complete halt to sardine fishing until the population recovers.\n\n**Key Statistics:**\n\n* 72% decline in sardine population", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment\u2014the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans\u2014which also depend on sardines for food\u2014are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)\u2014and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."]}

The study, which analyzed data from over 11,000 adults, found that while only 2% of the population currently follows a vegetarian or vegan diet, 10% have previously adopted these diets but have since reverted back to eating meat or animal products. This means that a staggering 84% of vegetarians and vegans eventually abandon their diets, with a third of them doing so within three months and more than half within the first year.\n\nThe study identified several key factors that contribute to the high rate of lapsed vegetarians and vegans. These include:\n\n*   **Rapid transition**: Most former vegetarians and vegans (65%) transitioned to their veg diet in just a few days or weeks, while fewer current vegetarians (53%) transitioned that quickly, suggesting that a slower approach may lead to longer-lasting results.\n*   **Social pressures**: A third of all former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarian or non-vegan partner, making it difficult to maintain their diet.\n*   **Difficulty in maintaining a \"pure diet\"**: Nearly 50% of former vegetarians and vegans found it too difficult to maintain a strict diet, leading to feelings of isolation and frustration.\n*   **Lack of social support**: More than 60% of former vegetarians and vegans disliked sticking out from the crowd because of their diet, and 58% did not see their diet as part of their identity.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for advocacy groups and individuals promoting vegetarian and vegan diets. The HRC recommends a shift in approach, focusing on reduction rather than elimination of animal products. This approach may be more effective in creating an overall decline in animal product consumption. Additionally, advocates should acknowledge the challenges of maintaining a vegetarian or vegan diet and provide support and resources to help individuals overcome these challenges.\n\nIn a personal account, a former vegetarian shares their experience of lapsing back into meat-eating after years of following a vegetarian diet.

Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent.

With accusations that Get Hard is homophobic and racist, Ferrell defends the flick to the AP, noting he and costar Kevin Hart \"show a mirror to what's already existing out there.\" Do critics agree? \"Perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but Get Hard is not it,\" Claudia Puig writes at USA Today. The film's \"jokes are a cavalcade of racist and homophobic humorlessness.\" And though its cracks at class divisions perform better, they aren't worth the price of a movie ticket. Her advice: \"Unless you're really hard up for entertainment, stay away from this tone-deaf raunchfest.\" It \"seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts,\" writes Peter Howell more favorably at the Toronto Star. The film will undoubtedly offend a portion of the audience, but \"I enjoyed it because, unlike similar films of its ilk, everybody is in on the joke,\" he writes: white, black; rich, poor; etc. \"It's not great cinema, but it's also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity.\" And \"Ferrell and Hart make a good team.\" Cary Darling at DFW is less kind. \"Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence,\" she writes. Excepting a scene in which Hart portrays a black guy, a Latino guy, and a gay black guy within a matter of minutes, the film just doesn't bring the laughs. Instead, it's \"weighed down by middle-school jokes.\" At its best, Get Hard \"does a smartly scathing job\" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. At its worst, it \"veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.\" Particularly, \"the movie is drenched in gay panic\" and includes \"tiresome 'don't drop the soap' jokes,\" based on Ferrell's character's fears about being raped in prison. At least \"Ferrell and Hart have a genial, easygoing chemistry,\" Hornaday writes."]}

This change aims to speed up the game, but not everyone is pleased with the decision.\n\nThe new rule, which was approved for the current season, replaces the traditional four-pitch intentional walk. However, some players and fans are nostalgic for the old way, citing the occasional excitement and unpredictability of the four-pitch walk. For instance, Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis has scored twice on errant pitches during intentional walks, and some fans have shared their favorite moments of batters hitting on intentional walks.\n\nDespite the change, the impact on game time may be minimal. According to MLB statistics, intentional walks took an estimated 35 seconds per game in 2016, and the new rule is expected to shave off only a few seconds from the average game time. In fact, a recent study found that the average intentional walk took 37.25 seconds, and the new rule may not make a significant difference.\n\nSome fans have even joked about the potential for a more exciting intentional walk, such as having the center fielder throw the pitches from 300 feet away. Others have suggested creative dugout signals, like mimicking the \"Walk like an Egyptian\" dance.\n\nThe MLB is also considering further changes to speed up the game, including eliminating the four pitches required for an intentional walk altogether.

According to various studies and reports, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to the development of \"superbugs\" that are resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to human health, with at least 2 million people getting an antibiotic-resistant infection and at least 23,000 people dying each year in the United States.\n\n**The Extent of the Problem**\n\nA study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics in the United States are not needed. This translates to approximately 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year. The majority of these prescriptions are for conditions that do not respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* About 13% of all outpatient visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription, with approximately 154 million visits annually.\n* More than 40% of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia.\n* Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses.\n\n**The Consequences of Antibiotic Overuse**\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics has led to the rise of drug-resistant superbugs, which pose a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. The CDC has warned that \"nightmare bacteria\" are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. The consequences of antibiotic overuse are severe, with the potential to undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections, cancer, and other life-threatening conditions.\n\n**A Call to Action**\n\nThe White House has set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020. Based on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15% overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. To achieve this goal, health care providers, patients, and the health care industry must work together to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Simple steps, such as displaying posters in patient waiting rooms, can help cut down on antibiotic prescribing", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2014the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post\u2014isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections\u2014meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"]}

The indictments, filed at the state court in Muenster, charge the men with being accessories to murder, alleging that they were aware of the killings that took place at the camp and willingly supported them in their roles as guards.\n\nThe two men, aged 93 and 92, served at the Stutthof camp, located near the Polish city of Gdansk, between 1942 and 1945. During this time, over 65,000 people died at the camp, with some being put to death in gas chambers, shot, or dying from malnutrition or exposure. The men, who have not been named, deny any knowledge of the killings, but prosecutors argue that they must have been aware of the atrocities that took place.\n\nThe indictments are part of a new approach by German prosecutors to pursue Nazi suspects who helped operate concentration camps during the war, even if they cannot be tied to specific crimes. This approach has led to several high-profile cases in recent years.\n\nOne of the key witnesses in the case is Judith Meisel, an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned at Stutthof.

John Lewis, and civil rights leader Julian Bond, who all attended Rosenwald schools.

Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was murdered on a street in Woolwich, south-east London, on Wednesday afternoon. The two suspects, Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were known to MI5 and had been under surveillance for eight years. Despite this, they were able to carry out the attack, which was filmed by a passer-by.\n\nThe suspects, who were shot and arrested by police, had been planning to ambush and murder the first police officers to arrive at the scene. They had lured police to the scene by dragging the body of the murdered soldier into the middle of the road. The police were able to shoot the suspects, but not before they had attacked the first police car to arrive, with one of the suspects charging at the driver's side of the vehicle.\n\nThe attack has sparked a debate over how to confront extremism in Britain, with Prime Minister David Cameron saying that the perpetrators were trying to divide the country, but that their actions would only bring people together and make them stronger. The Muslim Council of Britain has condemned the attack, calling it a \"barbaric act that has no basis in Islam.\"\n\nThe suspects had been known to intelligence officials for their involvement with Islamist extremists, and had previously been involved in protests and demonstrations. Michael Adebolajo, the 28-year-old suspect, had converted to Islam a decade ago and had been known to have radical views. He had also been involved in a fitness business and had worked as a fitness instructor.\n\nThe police have made two further arrests in connection with the attack, a 29-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, on suspicion of conspiring to murder. The police have also searched six residential addresses across London and in Lincolnshire, England.\n\nThe attack has raised questions about the effectiveness of the security services in preventing such attacks, and whether the suspects were acting on their own or as part of a larger network. The investigation is ongoing, with police working to determine the motives behind the attack and whether there were any connections to Nigeria.\n\nIn related news, the Internet Archive has been donating its crawl data to the Wayback Machine since 1996, with the data being added to the archive after an embargo period.

Other developments include: Police also haven't identified any of the suspects, but Adebolajo's name was widely reported yesterday, and today the Telegraph has identified the other alleged knife-man as the confusingly similarly named Michael Adebowale, 22. Neighbors identified Adebowale after police armed with submachine guns raided his flat yesterday, emerging with two children, a baby, and two large envelopes. Adebowale was apparently known for distributing radical Islamist leaflets, and his girlfriend had recently converted to Islam. \"When you walked past, you would hear them singing Muslim songs,\" one neighbor says, adding that she \"saw the man who was in the video go inside the house.

However, with women now making up half of the US workforce, the mission has been accomplished. The focus has shifted from simply showing girls what an office looks like to encouraging them to become leaders.\n\n**The Need for Leadership Encouragement:**\nGirls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job, but they do need encouragement to become leaders. In Fortune 500 companies, women hold only 3.6% of CEO positions, 14% of executive officer positions, and 16% of board director positions. This disparity is attributed to a lack of leadership opportunities and a need for sponsorship and support.\n\n**The Importance of Role Models and Sponsorship:**\nIntroducing girls to female role models and providing sponsorship can make a significant difference. A recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80% of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60% have not been offered the opportunity to see them in action. Companies can help by introducing their employees' daughters to women at the highest level of the company and highlighting their accomplishments.\n\n**Understanding Leadership:**\nGirls need to understand what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis, including the specific requirements and rewards of leadership. This can be achieved by making the responsibilities, roles, and payoffs of leadership clear from a young age. Hearing directly from both male and female leaders about what they actually do can help close the gap and make leadership more tangible.\n\n**Breaking Down Barriers:**\nTo move women into leadership roles, companies and schools need proactive efforts. Princeton University's initiative to encourage female students to apply for academic prizes is a successful example. The university's faculty started proactively encouraging female students, resulting in 3 out of 4 Princeton Rhodes Scholars being women in 2011.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSimply showing girls what an office looks like is no longer enough. Real breakthroughs will come when we bring girls inside the halls of power. We need to take our daughters into the C-Suite now so they can lead in the future. By introducing girls to female role models, providing sponsorship, and making leadership more tangible, we can encourage girls to become leaders and close the leadership gap.", "answers": ["Today is the 20th anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, and Jennifer Allyn at the Christian Science Monitor says it's time to declare mission accomplished and refocus on a bigger goal.

Now it's time to introduce girls to the executive suites, to give them role models of women as decision-makers.

The bill, which was sent to Rose's sister, Shaneice Luke, in March, is for Medicaid assistance from August 2002 to August 2012, the day of his death.\n\nAccording to the medical examiner, Rose's death was ruled a homicide, with evidence showing that he died from injuries caused by being physically restrained by three staffers, including a 275-pound worker who sat on him. The incident occurred in 2012, and Luke filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the agency and the developmental center. However, instead of taking responsibility for the death, the OPWDD is now demanding that Luke's estate pay the massive bill.\n\nAssemblyman Harvey Weisenberg called the move \"retaliation\" and \"an outrage,\" stating that it is unacceptable to send a bill to someone who lost a loved one due to abusive care. Attorney Ilann Maazel, who has filed lawsuits against the state on behalf of families who have lost loved ones in state care, said that this is a new tactic being used by the state, and it is \"problematic.\"\n\nThe OPWDD claims that they are following federal Medicaid obligations in seeking reimbursement, but critics argue that this is a clear attempt to intimidate and silence families who are seeking justice for their loved ones. The case has sparked outrage, with many calling for the state to take responsibility for the death of Rasheen Rose and to provide support to his family, rather than trying to collect a massive bill.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the quality of care provided at the Fineson Developmental Center, which has been criticized for its handling of patients.

The toy was released in October 2016 and quickly became a must-have gift, with parents lining up outside stores and paying up to seven times the retail price on online marketplaces. However, many parents and children were left disappointed when the toy failed to hatch, with some reporting that they had to open the egg themselves.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Jodie Hejduk on behalf of herself and a class of other affected consumers, alleges that Spin Master knew that the toy was defective and failed to take adequate steps to address the issue.

The legislation, which was voted through by 329 deputies to 229, with 10 abstentions, must now be passed by the Senate before it can become law.\n\nThe bill, which redefines marriage as a contract between two people rather than between a man and a woman, has been a contentious issue in France, with the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups opposing it. However, it has won the support of gay rights advocates, who see it as a major advance for equality of rights.\n\nThe bill is part of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's first major social reform and a key election pledge. If passed, it would make France the 12th country to allow same-sex marriage, joining countries such as Spain, Sweden, South Africa, and the Netherlands. Nine US states and Washington DC have also legalized same-sex marriage, and British lawmakers have recently voted for marriage equality in the UK.\n\nThe issue has sparked large protests in France, with around 340,000 people turning out in Paris to protest the reform. The anti-gay marriage camp, largely driven by the Catholic Church, has accused President Hollande of pushing through legislation without proper consultation.\n\nThe bill will now go to the left-wing-controlled Senate, which is expected to approve it on April 2. Once passed, the reform will be a significant step forward for French gay rights advocates and will join a growing list of countries that recognize same-sex marriage.\n\nThe issue of same-sex marriage is not unique to France, with many other countries grappling with the polarizing issue. In the UK, lawmakers have approved the second reading of a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, but it still has several stages to go before it can become law. In the US, same-sex marriage has been legalized in nine states and Washington DC, but many people remain opposed to the idea.\n\nThe debate over same-sex marriage has also divided Australia, where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. However, a poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed support marriage equality.\n\nThe issue of same-sex marriage has also been a contentious issue in other countries, with 76 countries still criminalizing same-sex relations and five countries imposing the death penalty for those who violate the laws.", "answers": ["Same-sex marriage is now just one step away from being legal in France.

The bill faced fierce opposition from France's Catholics, and from conservative lawmakers, who introduced more than 5,000 amendments to delay its passage. But now the bill needs only to clear the senate to become law, according to CNN. The vote comes as a similar bill is working its way through the UK parliament."]}

The study, which analyzed 50 homes in Austin, Texas, found that west-facing solar panels produced 2% more electricity during a normal day and 49% more electricity during peak demand hours (3-7 pm) compared to south-facing panels. This is a significant finding, as it suggests that homeowners with west-facing solar panels can reduce their peak energy usage by 65%, while those with south-facing panels can reduce their usage by 54%.\n\nThe study's lead researcher, Brewster McCracken, explained that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy in the late afternoon, which coincides with the time when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, increasing their energy usage. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are optimizing their solar power generation at the exact time when their energy usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.\n\nThe study's findings have the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market, as it opens up the possibility of installing solar panels on homes with west-facing roofs, which were previously thought to be unsuitable for solar installations. Additionally, the study suggests that utility companies may need to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, as they can help reduce the stress on the grid during peak demand periods.\n\nWhile the study's results are promising, it's essential to note that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's unclear how the results would translate to other seasons. However, the study's findings are consistent with a previous study by the California Public Utility Commission, which found that west-facing systems were more effective at offsetting peak load than south-facing ones.\n\nThe study's results have sparked debate among experts, with some arguing that the benefits of west-facing panels may vary depending on the region and the structure of incentives provided by utility companies.

That man, who was never caught, is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the LA area. Vargas had matched assailant descriptions, and he caught investigators' eye because he had a faded teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a 1992 rape conviction involving his girlfriend at the time, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"You can sentence me to all the years you want, but ... that individual that really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there,\" Vargas warned a judge before he was sentenced in 1999. In 2012, Vargas reached out to the California Innocence Project and asked to use DNA techniques to examine samples on the clothing of one of his alleged victims, per the Times. The DNA matched that of the victim and the Teardrop Rapist. The three victims had positively IDed Vargas as the perpetrator, but an Innocence Project attorney tells the AP it was a \"shaky witness\" case, an assertion the LA district attorney's office backed up in a recent court letter that said there were discrepancies and uncertainties in their identification of the rapist, the Times notes. Vargas still has to clear up some immigration issues before he's fully released, but he hopes to be home by Christmas."]}

The rover, which has been on Mars for almost a year and a half, has delivered its largest and most important findings to date, revealing a new understanding of the red planet's early epochs, three to four billion years ago.\n\n**Early Mars was Habitable**\n\nThe Curiosity team has found evidence that early Mars was habitable, with a lake existing in Gale Crater, where the rover is currently exploring. The lake, which was about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide, was a freshwater lake that could have supported microbial life. The lake's existence is significant, as it suggests that habitable environments were present on Mars more recently than previously thought.\n\n**Water on Mars**\n\nThe rover has also found evidence of water on many parts of Mars, including rivers, streams, and lakes. This contradicts previous observations made by satellites orbiting the planet, which suggested that Mars had a watery past. The Curiosity team has \"ground-truthed\" these observations, providing greater credibility to the view that thousands of fossil formations of ancient streams, channels, and lakes are real.\n\n**Organic Compounds on Mars**\n\nThe search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds, a major goal of the Curiosity mission, has been complicated by the presence of a chlorine-based compound that destroys organic material when heated. However, the rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument has identified six different organic compounds, although their origin is unclear. The search for Martian organics is ongoing, with each collection of Martian sand or rock leading to different results.\n\n**Radiation on Mars**\n\nThe Curiosity rover has made the first measurements of radiation on the surface of Mars, revealing that the planet is bombarded by galactic cosmic rays and solar eruptions. The high-energy particles break the bonds that allow organisms to survive, making it difficult for life to exist on the surface or less than several meters deep. However, life could theoretically still survive on Mars today under special circumstances.\n\n**New Method for Dating Martian Surfaces**\n\nThe Curiosity team has developed a new method for dating how long surfaces have been exposed to the sky on Mars. Using measurements of radioactive decay, the team has found that the surface of Yellowknife Bay has been exposed for 80 million years. This method could help the rover find places to drill where there has been less chemistry-damaging", "answers": ["The Curiosity rover has discovered evidence of an ancient freshwater lake on Mars that was brimming with the key chemicals necessary to support microbial life, and its findings suggest that it could have held that life more recently than we thought\u2014and possibly for millions of years before that. \"Quite honestly it just looks very Earth-like,\" the Curiosity's lead scientist said, according to Space.com. The lake, located in the Gale Crater, would have been about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide. The lake's mudstones\u2014which form in calm, still water\u2014contain traces of sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon, meaning it could have supported chemolithoautotrophs, a kind of microbial that obtains energy by breaking down rock minerals. The lake was revealed today amidst a barrage of papers on the Rover's progress. National Geographic breaks down some of the other key take-aways, including one that's less promising for Martian life hunters: Curiosity's first radiation measurements indicate levels that would be fatal, within a few million years, to anything within several meters of the surface.

The snake was first discovered in 1936 by American naturalist William Beebe on the remote Mexican island of Clarion, one of the Revillagigedo Islands, located over 400 miles off Mexico's Pacific coast.\n\nAfter Beebe's initial discovery, subsequent visits to the island failed to find any more of the snakes, and the species was largely struck from taxonomic registries, with the existing dead sample assumed to be a labelling error. However, Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected that the snake might still exist and led an expedition to the island in May to search for it.\n\nUsing Beebe's original field notes as a guide, Mulcahy and his team, including Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute, successfully found 11 snakes matching Beebe's description. DNA analysis confirmed that the Clarion Nightsnake is a distinct species, closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast, over 500 miles away. The researchers believe that the snake's ancestors may have made the journey from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is significant not only because of its rarity but also because of the fragility of island ecosystems. The Revillagigedo Islands, where the snake is found, are home to a small detachment of Mexican marines and are prone to changes in their ecosystem due to seasonal fluctuations.\n\nThe National Museum of Natural History has recognized the Clarion Nightsnake as a full species, and Mulcahy plans to continue monitoring the species to learn more about its role in the delicate Clarion Island ecosystem.

In an interview with GQ, Swift addressed claims that she is \"calculating\" and \"mean\" after Grizzly Bear's Edward Droste described her as such. Swift strongly disagreed, stating that she thinks about things before they happen, but that doesn't mean she is calculating. She also emphasized the importance of self-awareness in her career, saying that she tries to preserve it despite the pressures of fame.\n\nSwift also discussed her song \"Bad Blood,\" which many people believe is about her feud with Katy Perry. However, Swift claimed that the song is actually about the loss of a friendship, and that she deliberately said it was about losing a friend in an interview to divert attention away from the more personal interpretation. She also revealed that she closely monitors what people say about her online, and that she has a strategy for managing her public image.\n\nIn another interview with GQ, Swift spoke about her personal life and how it intersects with her career. She discussed her lack of female friendships in high school and middle school, which she believes is why her female friendships are so important to her now. She also talked about her experience with loneliness, saying that she doesn't feel lonely despite being around people all the time, and that she has learned to appreciate the fleeting moments of happiness in her life.\n\nSwift also addressed the infamous incident at the 2009 VMAs when Kanye West stormed the stage during her acceptance speech. She revealed that she was initially hurt by the crowd's booing, but that she has since made amends with West and values their friendship.\n\nIn a humorous take on the situation, a satirical article in GQ poked fun at Swift's reputation for being calculating, saying that she collects friends based on how many Instagram likes they can get her. The article also joked that Swift's friends are like members of the Justice League, each with their own specific role.\n\nOverall, Taylor Swift's recent interviews have shown her to be a thoughtful and self-aware artist who is aware of the pressures of fame and the ways in which her personal life is scrutinized by the public. She has also demonstrated a willingness to speak her mind and defend herself against criticism, while also showing a more vulnerable side in discussing her personal struggles and relationships.", "answers": ["During an extensive cover interview with Chuck Klosterman for GQ, the only time Taylor Swift \"appears remotely flustered,\" Klosterman writes, is when he relays a story to her about meeting a former acquaintance of Swift's a few years back who called her \"calculating.\" Swift \"really, really hates the word calculating,\" Klosterman writes. \"She despises how it has become tethered to her iconography and believes the person I met has been the singular voice regurgitating this categorization.\" Swift's defense: \"Am I shooting from the hip? Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing\u2014the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work\u2014and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive. You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.\" So who are Swift and Klosterman talking about? Dlisted, Celebuzz, and Gigwise think it's likely Edward Droste, member of the indie rock band Grizzly Bear, who earlier this year called Swift not only calculating but frightening, mean, rude, and arrogant (though he at first wouldn't say who he was talking about). As for the rest of the GQ interview, Swift also discusses the rumor that her song \"Bad Blood\" is about Katy Perry (she basically fueled the rumor because she didn't want anyone to think the song was about one of her exes) and the VMAs moment when Kanye West stormed the stage and interrupted her acceptance speech. \"That was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career,\" she says. \"And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other\u2014that's one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.\" Click for the full piece."]}

The allegations span several decades, with over 20 women coming forward to claim that Cosby drugged and/or sexually assaulted them. The most recent allegations include a claim from Chloe Goins, a 24-year-old woman who says she was 18 years old when she was drugged and assaulted by Cosby at the Playboy Mansion in 2008. Goins claims that Cosby gave her a drink that made her feel dizzy and unsteady, and she woke up to find him licking and kissing her toes. She also alleges that Cosby had his trousers down and was pleasuring himself.\n\nGoins' allegations are significant because they fall within the statute of limitations in California, which means that Cosby could potentially face criminal charges. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is investigating the allegations, and Goins has made a statement to police.\n\nAnother woman, Judy Huth, has also come forward with allegations against Cosby. Huth claims that she was 15 years old when she was drugged and assaulted by Cosby at the Playboy Mansion in 1974. Her lawsuit against Cosby is ongoing, and her lawyer has stated that two witnesses have corroborated her story.\n\nCosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, has denied the allegations and has called them an extortion attempt. However, the sheer number of allegations against Cosby suggests that there may be some truth to the claims.\n\nThe allegations against Cosby have also led to a response from Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy, who has distanced himself from Cosby. Hefner has stated that the allegations are \"truly saddening\" and that he would never tolerate such behavior.\n\nThe allegations against Cosby have also led to a response from the black media, with Cosby stating that he wants the black media to remain neutral on the charges against him. However, many have criticized Cosby for his response, with some accusing him of trying to silence his accusers.\n\nThe allegations against Cosby are a reminder of the importance of believing and supporting victims of sexual assault. The fact that so many women have come forward with allegations against Cosby suggests that there may be a pattern of behavior that needs to be addressed.\n\nIn related news, the LAPD is also investigating allegations of rape and drug use against Cosby, and two detectives have met with Judy Huth, who claims that Cosby drugged and raped her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974 when she was 15.

The filing doesn't offer specifics of what the witnesses know, the AP reports, but it does contain a psychologist's assessment that there's \"a reasonable basis to believe that Ms. Huth has been subject to childhood sexual abuse.\" Cosby, whose wife recently reacted to sex assault reports against him, isn't named in the psychological assessment. Meanwhile, yet another woman has come forward with allegations against Cosby, saying he drugged her at another Playboy Mansion party just six years ago, when she was 18. The timing means Cosby could still be criminally charged for the incident, the Hollywood Reporter notes. Chloe Goins plans to report the incident to police, the Daily Mail reports. She says she went to a party at the mansion, where she was introduced to Cosby, who gave her a drink, though she was underage. Feeling dizzy, she lay down in a room offered by Hugh Hefner, she says. Cosby allegedly guided her to the room, and when she woke up, she says, she was naked and he was licking her toes and masturbating. \"This isn't something I really wanted out there about myself,\" she says, but after so many women have come forward, \"I feel he needs to pay for it.\""]}

The contest has narrowed down to a three-way dead heat between Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, and Rick Santorum, according to the latest Iowa Poll. However, 41% of voters still have not made up their minds, indicating that the outcome is far from certain.\n\nRomney, the current front-runner, is banking on his electability as a key factor in his success. He has poured significant resources into Iowa and is expected to perform well, particularly in areas with high turnout. However, a poor showing could raise questions about his ability to win over the Republican base.\n\nRon Paul, on the other hand, is relying on his army of college activists and a strong ground game to propel him to victory. His campaign has been boosted by a surge in popularity, despite facing criticism for his past publication of a racist and anti-Semitic newsletter. Paul's message of liberty and limited government has resonated with many young voters and independents.\n\nRick Santorum, a Christian conservative from Pennsylvania, has seen a surge in popularity in recent days, particularly among social conservatives and evangelicals. He has raised more money in the last few days than in the previous few months and is expected to perform well in areas with high concentrations of these voters.\n\nOther candidates, including Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, and Rick Perry, are struggling to gain traction. Gingrich has seen a significant decline in the polls and is facing criticism for his past support of global warming legislation and his lobbying work for Freddie Mac. Bachmann's campaign has been marred by infighting and a lack of organization, while Perry's campaign has been plagued by gaffes and a lack of momentum.\n\nThe outcome of the Iowa caucuses will be closely watched, as it will set the tone for the rest of the primary season. A win for Romney would all but secure his nomination, while a loss could raise questions about his electability. A victory for Paul or Santorum would be a significant upset and could propel them to the forefront of the nomination process.\n\nKey counties to watch on caucus night include Black Hawk County, where Michele Bachmann was born and where her campaign went off the rails; Dallas County, a suburb of Des Moines where Romney and Huckabee battled to a near-tie in 2008; Dubuque County, where Romney ran strong in 2008 and where Santorum and Gingrich may find support among Catholic voters; Johnson County, a liberal enclave where Romney won", "answers": ["Tonight\u2019s the night!

The study, conducted by researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University, analyzed data from over 21,000 pregnancies and found that women who consumed two to four servings of potatoes or chips per week had a 27% higher risk of developing gestational diabetes. Those who ate more than five portions of potatoes or chips per week had a 50% higher risk.\n\nThe researchers propose that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grains may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. They estimate that swapping two servings of potatoes per week for other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods could lower the risk by 9-12%.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Cuilin Zhang, suggests that women can reduce their risk of gestational diabetes by making simple swaps, such as switching from baked or mashed potatoes to sweet potatoes or boiled new potatoes, choosing whole grain bread instead of white bread, and swapping frozen microwaveable French fries for pasta or noodles.\n\nHowever, UK experts have cautioned that the study's findings are not conclusive and that more research is needed to confirm the association between potato consumption and gestational diabetes. They also point out that potatoes are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and that women should not completely eliminate them from their diet.\n\nThe study's results are consistent with previous research that has linked high-glycemic foods, such as potatoes, to a higher risk of gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Dr. Aldo Palmieri, a physician at UCLA Santa Monica Hospital, notes that potatoes are high on the glycemic index and can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels.\n\nThe study's authors also found that substituting two servings of potatoes per week with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods was associated with a 9-12% lower risk of gestational diabetes. They recommend swapping in green leafy vegetables, such as kale or spinach, or whole grains, such as brown rice or quinoa, for potatoes.\n\nDr. Minisha Sood, a director of inpatient diabetes at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, notes that the study's findings are not surprising and that the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, has been shown to have benefits in terms of weight loss and insulin resistance.\n\nIn terms of practical advice", "answers": ["If your short-term plan involves getting pregnant, your immediate plan should potentially be to lay off the potatoes. So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

However, the cause of its sinking has been a mystery for over 150 years. Researchers have proposed various theories, including suffocation, damage to the hull from arms fire, and a lucky shot from a stray bullet. \n\nA new study published in PLoS One suggests that the crew of the Hunley died instantly from the shockwave generated by their own torpedo. The study, led by biomechanist Rachel Lance, used a 1/6 scale model of the Hunley to test the effects of the blast wave on the crew. The results showed that the shockwave would have caused catastrophic injuries to the crew's soft tissues, especially their brains and lungs, and would have left no mark on the skeletal remains.\n\nLance's research involved constructing a scale model of the Hunley and subjecting it to pressurized air blasts and black powder explosions while monitoring the effects with sensors. She also analyzed the effects of energy blasts on the human respiratory system and pored through documents at the National Archives in Washington. The study found that the crew would have been exposed to a blast wave of sufficient magnitude to cause instant death, with the calculated chances of survival being less than 16% for each crew member.\n\nThe Hunley's sinking occurred on February 17, 1864, when it attacked the Union warship USS Housatonic. The crew of the Hunley had enough air for little more than two hours, but suffocation was not a plausible explanation for their death. Lance also tested the theory that a stray bullet from the Housatonic caused the sub to sink, but her results showed that the damage was inconsistent with damage from her rifle fire.\n\nLance's research suggests that the blast wave from the explosion of the torpedo caused the crew to die instantly.

Over three years, Lance\u2014a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself\u2014carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive \u2026 analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub.

According to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the 20th-century rise was likely faster than any of the previous 27 centuries, with a rate of 1.4 millimeters per year from 1900 to 2000.\n\nThe study, led by Bob Kopp of Rutgers University, used a global database of regional sea-level reconstructions to estimate that the 20th-century rise was likely between 3 and 7 centimeters, rather than the observed 14 centimeters. The researchers attributed the anomalous 20th-century rise to global warming, which they found would have resulted in a much smaller sea level rise of between 3 and 7 centimeters if humans had not been warming the planet.\n\nAnother study published in the same journal found that global sea levels rose faster in the past century than during the previous 27 centuries due to man-made global warming. The study, which compiled a database of geological sea-level indicators from marshes, coral atolls, and archaeological sites around the world, found that the seas rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000, a significant increase, especially for low-lying coastal areas.\n\nThe research also suggests that the current rate of sea level rise, at 3.4 millimeters per year, is still accelerating. The study's lead author, Robert Kopp, noted that the methods used to project these totals may not fully capture what happens over the course of this century, as the major contributors to sea level rise in the 21st century will be the huge ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica.\n\nA separate study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that global sea level could increase by roughly one to four feet by 2100, depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases are released into the atmosphere in the coming decades.\n\nThe research also highlights the human fingerprints on coastal floods, with a study finding that thousands of U.S. coastal floods would not have occurred without human-caused global warming.

For the people who live there, the danger of radiation is a fact of life, but it's not the only story. Photojournalist Michael Forster Rothbart's book, \"Would You Stay?\", captures the relative normalcy of life near Chernobyl and Fukushima, where people adapt and survive despite the risks. However, the area is still home to many dangers, including cancer, poverty, and a lack of opportunity.\n\nThe Ukrainian government is seeking to develop solar power in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, which has been largely uninhabitable since the 1986 disaster. The area's cheap land and existing transmission lines make it an attractive location for renewable energy. Ukraine's environment minister, Ostap Semerak, believes that the Chernobyl site has \"good potential for renewable energy\" and that the project could help the country move closer to the European Union.\n\nIn Belarus, a 22.3 MW PV plant is already under construction near the Chernobyl disaster site, and Ukrainian developers plan to install a 4 MW solar project at the site by the end of the year. The Ukrainian government aims to increase the share of renewables in its energy mix to 11% by 2020.\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster itself remains a complex and contested topic. The official death toll is estimated to be around 4,000, but some estimates put the global death toll at 1.44 million. The disaster also had a profound impact on the environment, contaminating 40% of Europe and causing widespread health problems.\n\nToday, the area surrounding Chernobyl is a mix of abandoned buildings, overgrown roads, and wildlife. Alexandr Sirota, a local resident who grew up in Pripyat, has returned to the area and now runs tours of the irradiated zone. He lives with a Geiger counter around his neck and carries a second one in case the first malfunctions.\n\nThe long-term problem of the Chernobyl disaster is the 2,000-ton mass of radioactive material that remains at the site.

Lucky then, that \"we already have high-voltage transmission lines that were previously used for the nuclear stations,\" says Semerak. \"And we have many people trained to work at power plants\" (thousands still work at Chernobyl). Plus there's all that inexpensive land. Ukraine's interest in renewables is partly politically motivated given the fragile cease-fire with Kremlin-backed rebels near the Russian border, not to mention increasing friction with the Putin camp over natural gas bills. Semerak says four energy companies from Canada and two investment firms from the US have expressed interest in a solar complex at the Chernobyl site, while Ukrainian developers intend to install panels there before 2016 is through.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "Iran has been in the spotlight for its human rights record, particularly when it comes to the treatment of children and juvenile offenders. According to a report by Amnesty International, Iran has continued to execute juvenile offenders, despite being one of the few countries that still practices this form of punishment. The report, titled \"Growing Up on Death Row: The Death Penalty and Juvenile Offenders in Iran,\" reveals that between 2005 and 2015, at least 73 juvenile offenders were executed, and currently, at least 160 are on death row.\n\nThe Iranian government has made some attempts to reform its laws, but these efforts have been deemed insufficient by human rights organizations. The 2013 Islamic Penal Code allows judges to assess a juvenile offender's mental maturity at the time of the offense and potentially impose an alternative punishment to the death penalty. However, this provision has not been consistently applied, and many juvenile offenders continue to face the death penalty.\n\nIran has also ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the use of the death penalty against people under the age of 18. However, the country has made a reservation to the convention, stating that it will not abide by the provisions that are incompatible with its domestic laws and Islamic standards.\n\nIn addition to the issue of juvenile offenders, Iran has also been criticized for its treatment of children in general. The country has a high rate of child poverty, and many children are forced to work in hazardous conditions. The government has also been accused of using child labor in the carpet industry.\n\nThe Iranian government has also been criticized for its handling of cases involving children who have committed crimes. In one case, a 17-year-old girl named Mahsa was accused of killing her father in a fit of anger. Her brothers are requesting the death penalty for her, which has sparked outrage among human rights organizations.\n\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Iran has ratified, sets out a range of rights for children, including the right to life, the right to education, and the right to protection from exploitation and abuse. The convention also prohibits the use of the death penalty against people under the age of 18.\n\nIn conclusion, Iran's human rights record, particularly when it comes to the treatment of children and juvenile offenders, is a major concern.

And it's apparently much worse for girls than for boys, a deputy director for the group says. \"Iran continues to lag behind the rest of the world, maintaining laws that permit girls as young as 9 and boys as young as 15 to be sentenced to death,\" says Said Boumedouha. This in spite of supposedly significant changes to the country's Islamic Penal Code\u2014changes meant to offer judges \"alternative punishments\" to the death penalty when juveniles are involved. In fact, the need for those changes in the first place shows what a dismal failure Iran has been in dealing with this issue, since in 1994 it ratified its participation in the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that \"neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed [on] \u2026 persons below 18 years of age.\" \"The report debunks recent attempts by Iran's authorities to whitewash their continuing violations of children's rights and deflect criticism of their appalling record as one of the world's last executioners of juvenile offenders,\" the Amnesty report reads.

The plan would cover a wide range of benefits, including hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, and prescription drugs, as well as vision and dental benefits.\n\nThe plan would be funded through a progressive tax system, with the richest households paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes.

One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity\u2014the government\u2014pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek.

The Gemini program introduced a urine collection system, but it was not sufficient for longer missions. The Apollo program also had to contend with fecal matter, which required a specialized containment system.\n\n**Astronauts' Personal Stories**\n\nThe Apollo astronauts' personal stories reveal the human side of space travel. Neil Armstrong's urine collection bag is a testament to the ingenuity of the astronauts, who had to adapt to the challenges of space travel. Buzz Aldrin's experience of using a diaper on the moon highlights the difficulties of maintaining personal hygiene in space. Charlie Duke's accident on Apollo 16, where he urinated on his leg, is a comical but also poignant reminder of the challenges of space travel.\n\n**Legacy of the Apollo Program**\n\nThe Apollo program has left a lasting legacy in space exploration and education. The program's success has inspired generations of scientists, engineers, and astronauts. The Apollo 11 mission has also had a lasting impact on popular culture, with its iconic images and quotes becoming ingrained in our collective consciousness.\n\n**Modern Advances in Space Technology**\n\nToday, space technology has advanced significantly, with the International Space Station providing a platform for longer-term missions.

The Houston Chronicle resurrects the fascinating historical tidbit by way of the Science Channel's Moon Machines documentary series, in which engineer Donald Rethke explained the very precise nature of early space diapers. The Maximum Absorbency Garment system, donned by Gemini and Apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains Rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by Alan Shepard, who spent hours in the Freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \"suborbital hop.\" Denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit\u2014forcing Mission Control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on.

The change led to the contamination of the water with lead, causing permanent brain damage in children and other health problems.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, there was a significant increase in Legionnaires' disease cases in Genesee County, with 87 cases reported from June 2014 to November 2015, resulting in 10 deaths.

The bacteria usually enter the body from a person breathing it in, but it cannot spread between people. The most vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems.\n\nA drinking water expert, Marc Edwards, who studied Flint's water, said the rise in Legionnaires' disease cases was \"dramatic\" and there is a \"very strong likelihood\" the river's water played a role.

The crisis became apparent in October, when Snyder declared a state of emergency, and Michigan State Police joined others in distributing bottled water and water filters.\n\nThe state has urged all Flint parents with children younger than 6 to have their children's blood tested for exposure to lead. A fund has been established to address the short- and long-term needs of Flint children exposed to lead through contaminated drinking water.\n\nThe city's water is still unsafe to drink, and officials have not given a firm time estimate as to when the water might be drinkable again.

In Pennsylvania, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver during a fatal accident can be held liable for the accident, setting a precedent that third-party texters can be held accountable if they are aware the driver is texting and will view the text while on the road. This decision follows a 2013 New Jersey appellate ruling that established the same cause of action against third parties in motor vehicle accident litigation.\n\nIn New Jersey, a court ruled that a person sending a text message to a driver can be liable if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and be distracted. The court emphasized that the sender's liability is not automatic and requires additional proofs, such as evidence that the sender knew or had special reason to know that the driver would read the message while driving.\n\nThe Pennsylvania ruling and the New Jersey court decision have significant implications for those who text while driving. If a person knows or has reason to believe that the recipient is driving and will view the text, they may be held liable for any accidents that result from the driver's distraction. This could lead to a change in behavior, as people become more aware of the potential consequences of their actions.\n\nIn addition to these court rulings, there are also legislative efforts underway to crack down on distracted driving. In New York, lawmakers have proposed a \"textalyzer\" bill that would allow police officers to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that is not in accordance with state laws. The bill also proposes that drivers would be forced to hand over their phone after a wreck or risk a driver's license suspension.\n\nThe textalyzer bill and the Pennsylvania ruling are part of a broader trend of increasing awareness and concern about distracted driving. As Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, notes, \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin, a kind of inside joke writ large, an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges.\" However, he believes that these legal developments could signal a change in thinking regarding distracted driving and help accelerate that change.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether phone and app developers will be held accountable for accidents caused by their products, the trend suggests that society is moving towards greater accountability for those who contribute to distracted driving.

In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend\u2014who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle\u2014was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver\u2014it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin \u2026 an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ...

According to the report, the CEOs of America's top 350 companies earned 312 times more than their workers on average last year. This pay gap has been increasing steadily since the 1990s, with some fluctuations. In 1965, the ratio of CEO to worker pay was 20 to one, which rose to 58 to one by 1989 and peaked in 2000 at 344 times the wage of their average worker.\n\nThe report attributes the rise in CEO compensation to stock-related components, such as stock awards and realized stock options. In 2017, the value of exercised stock options accounted for 78.9% of the year-over-year growth in CEO compensation, while the value of stock awards accounted for 40.7%. The report also notes that the pay of CEOs has far outpaced that of very highly paid workers, the top 0.1% of earners.\n\nThe EPI report also highlights the impact of CEO compensation on the broader economy. The authors argue that the escalation of CEO compensation has fueled the growth of top 1% incomes, with households headed by nonfinancial-sector executives and financial-sector workers accounting for 58% of the expansion of income for the top 1% of households.\n\nThe report suggests several policy options to reverse the trend of excessive executive pay and broaden wage growth, including implementing higher marginal income tax rates at the very top, setting corporate tax rates higher for firms with higher ratios of CEO-to-worker compensation, and changing corporate governance practices, such as greater use of \"say on pay.\"\n\nThe data used in the report comes from the Compustat database, which provides information on executive compensation and corporate governance practices.

Despite his best efforts to control his addiction, he lost over $4.8 million in a single year and eventually took his own life.\n\nStevens's story is not unique. According to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, 1.1 to 1.6 percent of the adult population in the United States has a gambling disorder, which translates to approximately 3 million to 4 million Americans.

They use loyalty cards, ATMs, and other tools to track players' behavior and target them with customized perks and VIP treatment.

However, a recent study has found that older fathers may also have a unique advantage: their sons are more likely to be \"geekier\" and have higher IQs.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers at King's College London, analyzed data from over 15,000 twins and found that sons of older fathers scored higher on the \"Geek Index,\" a measure of non-verbal IQ, focus, and social aloofness. The researchers also found that the older the father, the higher the score.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Magdalena Janecka, suggests that the link between older fathers and geekier sons may be due to the fact that older men are more likely to have higher levels of \"geekiness\" themselves. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of 'geekiness,'\" she said.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate about the potential benefits of older fatherhood.

The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry. They calculate that 57% of the geek index score is inherited, with possible overlap between genes that contribute to a high geek score and to autism. \u201cOur primary hypothesis is that higher levels of those \u2018geeky\u2019 traits in offspring of older men are mainly due is due to characteristics of the fathers themselves,\" Janecka tells Newsweek. \"Men who decide to delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and likely themselves display higher levels of \u2018geekiness.\u2019\u201d (Younger fathers are also likelier to die younger.)"]}

In the 19th century, inventors patented various devices and methods to simulate death, including a beheading trick, a coffin-shaped poison bottle, and a device to remove decomposition fluid from caskets.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have been studying the \"smell of death\" to better understand the decomposition process and develop methods to detect human remains. A study published in 2010 by the Belgian Disaster Victim Identification Team found that decomposing humans release a unique chemical cocktail, which could be used to train cadaver dogs and develop machines that can detect human remains.\n\nA more recent study published in PLOS ONE identified 452 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released during the decomposition of human and animal remains. The researchers found that a combination of eight compounds, including diethyl disulfide, methyl(methylthio)ethyl disulfide, and 3-methylthio-1-propanol, could distinguish human and pig remains from other animal remains. However, these compounds were not unique to humans and were also found in other animal remains.\n\nFurther analysis revealed that a combination of five esters, including ethyl propionate, propyl propionate, propyl butyrate, and ethyl pentanoate, could separate pig and human remains. These esters were also found in other pig studies, but not in mice remains. The researchers suggested that these esters could be used as human and pig specific markers.\n\nThe study had some limitations, including the use of glass jars to decompose only parts of organs and tissues, which may not replicate the full decomposition process. However, the results provide an important step in the search for human specific markers and could lead to the development of more efficient methods for detecting human remains.\n\nIn a separate study, researchers found that decomposing human bodies release a unique five-chemical cocktail, including 3-methylbutyl pentanoate, 3-methylbutyl 3-methylbutyrate, 3-methylbutyl 2-methylbutyrate, butyl pentanoate, and propyl hexanoate, which distinguishes them from other rotting animals.

By collecting the gases building up in the jars, researchers identified 452 organic compounds, according to Science. Eight of those compounds were found only in decomposing humans and surprisingly human-like pigs, and five of them were unique to humans. These five compounds\u2014called esters\u2014were created by decomposing muscles, carbohydrates, and fat, Discovery reports.

This ice loss has contributed to a global sea level rise of about 7.6 millimeters over the past quarter century. The study, conducted by an international team of ice experts, used 24 different methods to analyze ice loss, including satellite data, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations.\n\nThe researchers found that the ice sheet in West Antarctica, which accounts for most of the melting, is in a state of collapse. The study estimates that the continent has lost about 84 billion tons of ice per year from 1992 to 2011, increasing to over 241 billion tons per year from 2012 to 2017. This rapid ice loss is primarily due to warmer ocean waters nibbling at the floating edges of ice sheets from below, which is connected to global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nThe study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd, warned that Antarctica alone could contribute about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century. This is a significant concern, as sea levels are already rising due to melting land glaciers, Greenland's dwindling ice sheet, and the expansion of warmer water.\n\nWhile East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice, with about 31 tons per year since 2012, scientists are not confident that this trend will continue. The study's co-author, Ian Joughin, suggested that East Antarctica may be stable for a couple of decades due to natural variability, rather than climate change.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with other research, including a recent study that found that East Antarctic ice sheet did not retreat significantly 2-5 million years ago when carbon dioxide levels were similar to those today. The situation is dire, according to Twila Moon, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\nThe study's results have significant implications for global sea levels and coastal communities. As the ice sheet continues to melt, it will contribute to more frequent and severe flooding events, making it essential for governments to take action to protect low-lying areas.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* 3 trillion tons of ice lost since 1992\n", "answers": ["Scientists monitoring ice loss in Antarctica have chilling news: The melting rate has accelerated alarmingly and the ice sheet is now shedding more than 200 billion tons a year, according to a study involving 88 scientists published in the journal Nature.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"\u2014and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they\u2019re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that\u2019s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it\u2019s the area that we\u2019re most worried about, because it\u2019s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

Oliver Cowdery was the primary scribe for the original manuscript, and many others took up a quill to assist Joseph during the translation.\n\nThe Book of Mormon has gone a long way since its first publication in 1830.

The move has sparked outrage from environmentalists, Native American tribes, and outdoor enthusiasts, who argue that the decision is an attack on the country's public lands and a betrayal of the trust placed in the government to protect these areas.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn 1996, President Bill Clinton designated 1.7 million acres in southern Utah as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, which was met with opposition from local officials and residents who felt that the decision was a land grab and would harm the local economy. The monument was established under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which allows the president to designate national monuments without congressional approval.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama designated two new national monuments, Bears Ears and Gold Butte, which were seen as a victory for Native American tribes and conservationists. However, the move was met with opposition from state Republican leaders and rural residents who argued that it would add another layer of federal control and restrict energy development.\n\n**Trump's Decision**\n\nOn December 4, 2017, President Trump signed two presidential proclamations that shrunk the size of Bears Ears National Monument by 85% and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by 45%. The decision was seen as a victory for the oil and gas industry and a blow to environmentalists and Native American tribes.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe decision has sparked a fierce backlash from environmentalists, Native American tribes, and outdoor enthusiasts. Patagonia, an outdoor retailer, has sued the Trump administration to block the decision, arguing that it is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and strips much-needed protections from sacred tribal lands. The company has also replaced its home page with a message saying \"The President Stole Your Land.\"\n\n**Lawsuits**\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed to challenge Trump's decision, including one by a coalition of five tribes and another by environmental and conservation groups. The lawsuits argue that the president does not have the authority to downsize national monuments and that the decision jeopardizes a wealth of Native American artifacts, dinosaur fossils, and rugged spaces.\n\n**Future of Public Lands**\n\nThe decision has raised questions about the future of public lands in Utah and the", "answers": ["Go to Patagonia's website and you're greeted with a message Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has deemed \"nefarious\": \"The President Stole Your Land.\" The California company is referring to President Trump's move to shrink the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, but it's not stopping at that: It filed a lawsuit Wednesday to block the Bears Ears slashing, joining three other legal challenges to save the monuments, the AP reports. The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands. The AP notes more lawsuits are anticipated, especially if Trump moves on Zinke's push to cut other national monuments. More in Time from Patagonia's CEO on why the company is suing."]}

Tiffany Sayre, 26, disappeared on May 11, 2015, and her body was found wrapped in a bed sheet in a drainage pipe. Timberly Clayton, 25, was found dead with three gunshot wounds, and her death is being investigated as a homicide.\n\nThe victims all had similar stories, with most of them struggling with drug addiction and prostitution. They also knew each other, which has led authorities to suspect a connection between the cases. The police have received over 100 tips, but no arrests have been made.\n\nThe families of the victims are critical of the police department, accusing them of not taking the cases seriously and not providing them with information. The police have denied these allegations, saying that each case has been assigned to a detective and that they are actively investigating.\n\nThe disappearances have also led to concerns about sex trafficking in the area. A registered nurse and prostitute on Second Street in Chillicothe reported being pulled into a van and beaten, but not reporting it to the police because they don't care about cases involving addicts or prostitutes.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, with the FBI and local authorities working together to find answers.

The overcrowding and unstable weather conditions on the mountain have led to a series of tragic incidents, including the death of at least 16 Sherpas in an avalanche on April 18th. This is the worst climbing accident in the history of Everest, and it has sparked outrage and demands for better compensation and working conditions for the Sherpas.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the commercialization of climbing on Everest, with many expeditions prioritizing the interests of Western clients over the safety of the Sherpas. The Sherpas, who are paid relatively low wages and receive inadequate insurance benefits, are calling for better working conditions, higher compensation, and greater recognition for their role in supporting the climbing expeditions.\n\nThe Nepali government has been criticized for its response to the tragedy, with many Sherpas feeling that the offer of 40,000 rupees (approximately $400) to the families of the deceased is inadequate. The Sherpas are demanding a higher compensation package, including a permanent relief fund, increased insurance benefits, and a monument to memorialize the deceased.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the growing trend of Everest becoming a spectator sport, with many climbers and guides prioritizing the thrill of the climb over the risks involved. The use of social media and other communication technologies has made it easier for climbers to share their experiences and attract sponsors, but it has also created a culture of voyeurism and a lack of respect for the risks involved.\n\nThe statistics on the fatality rate of Sherpas on Everest are alarming, with a death rate 12 times higher than that of US military personnel in Iraq from 2003-2007. The Sherpas are paid relatively low wages, with an average of $2,000 to $8,000 per expedition, and receive inadequate insurance benefits. The Nepali government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and many are calling for greater recognition and compensation for the Sherpas who risk their lives to support the climbing expeditions.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the impact of climate change on the mountain, with many experts suggesting that the warming of the Himalayan climate is making the icefall more unstable and increasing the risk of accidents.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest\u2014one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."]}

The study, published in the journal PLoS One, found that people can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men by viewing their faces in photographs, but not women. The researchers used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape.\n\nThe study found that faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are longer, with a wider distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. On the other hand, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin.\n\nHowever, the researchers found no correlation between morphological traits and real intelligence measured with IQ tests, either in men or women. The study also found that the ability to accurately assess intelligence from faces is not based on facial shape, but rather on some unidentified visual cues.\n\nThe researchers proposed several explanations for why people can predict men's intelligence but not women's intelligence based on their faces. One possible explanation is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces. Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness, which may prevent an accurate assessment of their intelligence.\n\nThe study also found that people who are perceived as more attractive are also perceived as more intelligent, and that this link is stronger for women's faces than men's faces.

Ren\u00e9e Cross, senior director for the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston, tells the Texas Tribune that the numbers are \"very impressive.\" \"We see so much anger or enthusiasm about candidates in much higher numbers than we\u2019ve ever seen,\" she says. \"From a political standpoint, I think there\u2019s just as much energy that we\u2019ve seen in presidential years.\" In other election news: Trump praises \"Beautiful Ted.\" President Trump appeared at a Houston rally for Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday, where both men made it clear the bitterness of the 2016 campaign was behind them. Before he flew to Texas, Trump told reporters that he now called Cruz \"Beautiful Ted\" or \"Texas Ted\" instead of \"Lyin' Ted,\" reports the Washington Post. At the rally, the two men embraced and Cruz told the crowd that he is looking forward to hitting the campaign trail for Trump's re-election bid in 2020. Trump described Cruz's opponent, Beto O'Rourke, as \"overrated.\" \"You know what I am? I'm a nationalist.\" At the Cruz rally, Trump attacked Democrats as a \"big risk to the American family\" and accused them of \"encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders, and overwhelm our nation,\" the AP reports. He also attacked globalists, declaring himself to be a nationalist. GOP may have the edge in early voting. According to data analyzed by NBC News, talk of a \"blue wave\" may be overstated: In early voting, Republican-affiliated voters have outnumbered Democrats in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Tennessee, and Texas, while Democrats are ahead in Nevada. Trump \"plans to distance himself from GOP losses.\" Insiders tell Politico that while Trump is currently describing the midterm vote as a vote on his presidency, he plans to break with recent precedent and distance himself from the results if there are serious GOP losses. The sources say Trump is likely to blame losses on House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2014as well as the media. One GOP insider says Trump has said of McConnell and Ryan: \"These are their elections ... and if they screw it up, it's not my fault.\" Dems lower \"blue wave\" expectations. Trump may not have to distance himself from results: With congressional races tightening, Democrats have been trying to lower expectations of a \"blue wave,\" the Hill reports.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "Astronomers have been making waves in the scientific community with the discovery of a potential ninth planet in our solar system, dubbed Planet Nine. The discovery was made by Mike Brown, a renowned astronomer at Caltech, and his co-author Konstantin Batygin. According to their research, published in the Astronomical Journal, Planet Nine is estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun at an average distance of 20 times farther than Neptune. The planet's existence was inferred from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, which appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet.\n\nBrown, who is often referred to as the \"Pluto killer\" due to his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006, believes that Planet Nine is a significant discovery that could rewrite the textbooks on our solar system. He and Batygin initially set out to disprove the existence of a hidden planet, but their research revealed that the gravitational effects of a massive perturber were the most plausible explanation for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked excitement among astronomers, with some estimating that the odds of its existence are as high as 90%. However, others have cautioned that the evidence is still circumstantial and that further observations and detections of perturbed bodies are needed to confirm the hypothesis.\n\nBrown's discovery of Planet Nine has also reignited the debate over Pluto's status as a planet. While some scientists argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet, Brown believes that it is not a planet and that the controversy will eventually die down. He argues that the International Astronomical Union's decision to demote Pluto was necessary for the good of science and that it has allowed us to better understand the solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine and the ongoing debate over Pluto's status highlight the dynamic and ever-changing nature of our understanding of the solar system. As scientists continue to explore and study the outer reaches of our solar system, we may uncover even more surprises and challenges to our current understanding of the cosmos.\n\nIn related news, NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system, and that the Sagan Rule applies: \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\" However, Brown and Batygin's research has provided a treasure map for astronomers to search for Planet", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet\u2014and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question\u2014it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The conflict has resulted in over 33,000 deaths, with more than 20 people killed in a recent string of government airstrikes on rebel areas in the north. The airstrikes, which hit four towns in Idlib and Aleppo provinces, have left residents searching for survivors amidst the rubble.\n\nThe economic toll of the war is also severe, with the country's economy heavily hurt by the conflict. Inflation has risen to at least 36 percent, and the currency has dropped around 50 percent, now trading at 75 pounds to the dollar on the black market. Factories have been burned down or damaged in fighting, and international sanctions have restricted the finances of wealthy Syrians, who are seeing their businesses pummeled by the war.\n\nWealthy Syrians, who were once cultivated by President Bashar Assad as a support for his regime, are now losing faith in the government. Many have fled abroad, hoping to ride out the turmoil, while others are hunkering down, trying to salvage their companies. Businessmen interviewed by the Associated Press expressed resentment against Assad, but also fear of what may happen to Syria if his regime collapses.\n\nThe conflict has also taken a toll on the Alawite minority, who have historically formed an important component of the opposition to Assad's rule. However, they have been heavily recruited into the security services and have since been propelled onto the front lines as the accelerating defections of Sunni soldiers call into question the reliability of Sunni units. The army is also increasingly relying on groups of armed irregulars known as the shabiha, drawn mostly from the Alawite community.\n\nRumblings of discontent within the Alawite minority are presenting a new challenge to President Assad's efforts to retain power. A shootout between members of the extended Assad family in the president's ancestral home town of Qardaha has hinted at unease within the community. The incident has sparked suspicions that the quarrel reflected deeper political differences within the community, with some Alawites questioning the direction in which Assad is leading them.\n\nThe government's reliance on the Alawite community for support has been a key factor in its ability to maintain power, but the tensions within the community suggest that this support may be waning.

The spacecraft, launched in 2006, has traveled over 3 billion miles to reach the dwarf planet, which was once considered the ninth planet in our solar system but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\n**New Discoveries and Insights**\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft has already delivered data that is \"a gift for the ages,\" according to principal investigator Alan Stern. The data reveals that Pluto is larger than previously thought, with a diameter of 1,473 miles, and its interior contains more ice than rock. The spacecraft has also detected nitrogen escaping from Pluto's atmosphere, which could be a sign of a more complex atmospheric structure than previously thought.\n\n**The Flyby**\n\nThe flyby is a complex operation that requires the spacecraft to fly through a \"keyhole\" in space, just 100km by 150km, and arrive at the location within a margin of 100 seconds. The spacecraft will take hundreds of observations of Pluto and its five moons, including Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. The first high-resolution images will be released on Wednesday afternoon, and the rest of the data will trickle in over the next 16 months.\n\n**The Mission**\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft is the fastest spacecraft ever launched, traveling at over 30,000 miles per hour.

We've already learned a lot of new things about Pluto. \"The science we've already made is mouth-watering,\" says Stern. \"The Pluto system is enchanting in its strangeness and its alien beauty.\" Among NASA's findings in recent days: Pluto's North Pole has an icy cap and the planet's diameter is 1,597 miles across, not 1,471 miles as previously thought. The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

The new measurements indicate that the universe is expanding at a rate of 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec, which is 5-9% higher than the previously estimated rate. This discrepancy has sparked a new wave of interest in the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which make up 95% of the universe but do not emit light.\n\nThe study, led by Nobel laureate Adam Riess, used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The researchers used a new method to calculate the distances, which involved measuring the brightness of Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. The new measurements have a margin of error of just 2.4%, making them the most accurate ever.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. If the discrepancy holds up, it could mean that dark energy, a mysterious force thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, is more powerful than previously thought. Alternatively, it could suggest that Einstein's theory of general relativity is incomplete or inaccurate.\n\nOther possible explanations for the discrepancy include the presence of unknown subatomic particles, such as dark radiation, which could be pushing galaxies apart at an even faster rate. The study also raises the possibility that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to the presence of dark matter, which is thought to make up a significant portion of the universe's mass-energy budget.\n\nThe discovery has sparked a new era of research into the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Scientists are using a range of methods, including the Hubble Space Telescope and future telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope, to try to understand the underlying physical processes that are driving the universe's expansion.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked debate among scientists, with some arguing that the discrepancy could be due to a mistake in the measurements or calculations. However, the researchers behind the study are confident that their results are accurate and are calling for further investigation into the nature of dark matter and dark energy.\n\nOverall, the discovery of the universe's faster-than-expected expansion rate has significant implications for our understanding of the universe and its ultimate fate. As scientists continue to study the phenomenon, they may uncover new insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the underlying physical processes that shape the universe.", "answers": ["New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: The universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5% to 9% quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, UPI reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by NASA and the European Space Agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number\u2014and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties\u2014then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor. While 5% to 9% may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \"major discrepancy\" in this particular case, notes Gizmodo. Part of the answer around the discrepancy may lie in the \"mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" says another of the project's researchers.

Honduras rallied from two goals down to beat Mexico, and Panama rallied from one goal back to beat Costa Rica. Had either of those games gone the other way, or had the US even tied Trinidad and Tobago (which had previously been eliminated from qualifying), the Americans would have secured a spot in Russia for the 2018 competition. Of note: Phantom goal: The winning goal scored by Panama against Costa Rica didn't cross the goal line, per CBS Sports, which has video here. The story raises the faint hope that the US could appeal the goal ruling, but it seems unlikely. \"As far as I know, there is no recourse,\" says a US soccer official.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed that the virus can be spread through sex, in addition to mosquito bites. The CDC has also warned that pregnant women are at greatest risk for Zika, and has advised them to postpone travel plans to areas where the virus has been reported.\n\n**Flooding in Louisiana and Zika Risk**\n\nRecent flooding in Louisiana has raised concerns about the potential for an increase in Zika cases in the region.

Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \"crunch time.\" Hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including West Nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

The strange story started when Bekah Martinez's mom reported her missing to the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office on Nov. 18. According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week.

The event aims to bring together 150 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to brainstorm innovative solutions to the current problems with breast pumps. These issues include a loud motor, too many parts, difficulty in cleaning, inability to pump while lying down, lack of space to pump, and social stigma surrounding breastfeeding.\n\nThe hackathon is a response to the lack of innovation in maternal health, which is an area that \"lags behind others\" in terms of innovation. The event is also inspired by the fact that breast pumping is an experience that many women hate, yet it saves the lives of premature babies and allows working women to continue nursing their babies.\n\nThe current breast pump design has remained largely unchanged since its invention in the 1920s, with the first mechanical breast pump being patented by Edward Lasker. The design has been criticized for being loud, cumbersome, and embarrassing, with many women feeling like they are being treated like cows in an industrial farm.\n\nThe hackathon aims to create a more dignified and user-friendly breast pump that will make the lives of working mothers easier and more pleasant. The event is sponsored by several companies, including Vecna Technologies, Medela, and Naia Health, and offers prizes for the most innovative solutions.\n\nThe hackathon is not just about improving breast pumps, but also about making space for innovation in family life more broadly. The event is open to the public, and registration is free, although space is limited. The organizers are also offering scholarships to attendees who work with low-income mothers to help them attend the event.\n\nThe breast pump market is a lucrative one, with the market expected to reach 5.63 million units by 2015. However, despite the health benefits of breastfeeding and the potential for profit, the design of the breast pump has remained largely unchanged. The hackathon aims to change this by bringing together a diverse group of people to create innovative solutions to the problems with breast pumps.\n\nThe event is also inspired by the idea that if men could breastfeed, the breast pump would be designed to be more elegant and user-friendly.

The review will include help from the Innocence Project and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.\n\nThe review is a response to the discovery that nearly every examiner in the FBI's microscopic hair comparison unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against defendants over a two-decade period before 2000. Of 28 examiners, 26 overstated forensic matches in ways that favored prosecutors in more than 95% of the 268 trials reviewed so far.\n\nThe review has already led to the exoneration of four defendants, and prosecutors have moved to overturn the conviction of another defendant.

The investigation has found that the FBI's hair and fiber unit made statements exceeding the limits of science in about 90% of testimonies, including 34 death-penalty cases.\n\nThe review has been ongoing since 2012, but was halted in August 2015 due to a debate within the FBI and DOJ about the appropriate scientific standards to apply when reviewing FBI lab examiner testimony.

The movie's poor performance can be attributed to several factors, including its confusing title, lack of recognizable faces, and failure to appeal to both children and adults.\n\nThe BFG's box office performance was disappointing, especially considering its high production budget and the presence of Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg. The movie's domestic total is expected to be around $55-$65 million, with its success relying heavily on overseas figures.

Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d"]}

The airstrikes, which were carried out by Tomahawk missiles, targeted the Shayrat airbase in Homs, Syria, and were aimed at the base's airstrips, hangars, control tower, and ammunition areas. The US military said that the airstrikes were a response to the chemical attack, which was carried out by the Syrian government.\n\n**International Reaction**\n\nThe international community has been divided in its reaction to the airstrikes. Russia, a key ally of the Syrian government, condemned the strikes as an \"act of aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the strikes were a \"serious obstacle\" to creating an international coalition against terrorism. Iran, another key ally of the Syrian government, also condemned the strikes, calling them \"unilateral action\" that violates international law.\n\nOn the other hand, many countries have welcomed the airstrikes as a necessary response to the chemical attack. The UK, France, and Italy have all expressed support for the US action, with the UK's Prime Minister Theresa May saying that the strikes were an \"appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime.\" Saudi Arabia has also backed the US strike, calling it a \"courageous decision\" by President Donald Trump.\n\n**US Congressional Reaction**\n\nThe US Congress has been divided in its reaction to the airstrikes. Some lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have expressed support for the airstrikes, while others, including Senators Rand Paul and Ted Lieu, have raised concerns about the constitutionality of the strikes. The Congressional Research Service has noted that the US has a history of conducting military actions without congressional authorization, but some lawmakers have argued that the strikes require congressional approval.\n\n**Syrian Government Response**\n\nThe Syrian government has condemned the airstrikes, with President Bashar al-Assad saying that the US \"aggression\" has increased the government's resolve to \"hit those terrorist agents, to continue to crush them.\" The Syrian government has also accused the US of \"naively\" being sucked in by a false propaganda campaign about the chemical attack.\n\n**UN Response**\n\nThe UN Security Council has begun an emergency session to discuss the situation in Syria, with the US, which currently holds the rotating presidency, deciding not to acquiesce to a request from Bolivia to hold the talks", "answers": ["President Trump's decision to strike a Syrian airbase in retaliation for a chemical attack on civilians has bipartisan support\u2014and bipartisan opposition.

Republicans including Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee, meanwhile, were joined by Democrats such as Sen. Tim Kaine in slamming Trump for launching the strikes without congressional approval. In other developments: Syria says the strike, which involved around 60 Tomahawk missiles launched from US destroyers in the Mediterranean, killed six people, wounded several others, and caused \"significant\" damage, the Los Angeles Times reports. A statement from the Syrian military denounced the strike as \"blatant aggression\" that will be a setback to its \"counterterrorist\" activity. Deutsche Welle reports that the attack was endorsed by European countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Bashar al-Assad bears \"sole responsibility\" for the strike against his regime's forces. Russia's military says only 23 out of the 59 American missiles reached the Shayrat airbase in Homs province, the AP reports. The military says the attack destroyed six Syrian planes, but left the runway intact. Vladimir Putin has denounced the strike as American aggression, a spokesman says. The New York Times looks at the risks and opportunities the strike has opened up for Trump. There's now an opportunity for the US to demand that Russia help get rid of Assad\u2014but there's the risk Putin might reject any such deal, that the strike could hurt the fight against ISIS, and that Trump's team has no real plan for peace in Syria. Syrian opposition groups welcomed the attack and said they hoped it marked the beginning of a wider campaign against Assad. \"For Syrians, any military intervention that will neutralize Assad\u2019s ability to continue his genocide will fall on our hearts like music,\" a civil defense volunteer in northern Syria tells the Los Angeles Times.

He began playing the ukulele at a young age and was influenced by traditional folk music. He attended Harvard University, where he became involved in the Young Communist League and began to develop his musical skills. After dropping out of college, Seeger traveled the country, learning and performing folk songs, and eventually formed the Almanac Singers with Woody Guthrie.\n\nSeeger's music career spanned over six decades, during which he gained fame with the Weavers, a group he formed in 1948.

The researchers stress that people bereaved by suicide should not be made to feel responsible for the death and should be treated with the same compassion as those bereaved by any other cause.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Alexandra Pitman, notes that people can find it difficult to know what to say to someone who has recently been bereaved, but suggests that saying something is often better than saying nothing, and simple gestures like offering practical help with day-to-day activities can mean a lot.\n\nThe study's findings also suggest that a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should be considered when assessing suicide risk, and that asking about the impact of a suicidal loss can give professionals a sense of how it has affected a person's day-to-day functioning and whether feeling stigmatized has prevented them from accessing help.\n\nThe study's results are published in the journal BMJ Open and are of significant importance in understanding the impact of suicide on those left behind.

The US has been cautious in providing aid to the Syrian opposition, fearing that it could fall into the hands of extremist groups like Jabhat al-Nusra. However, the Obama administration has announced plans to provide a new tranche of non-lethal aid to the rebels, separate from Jabhat al-Nusra.\n\nThe merger has also been seen as a strategic move by Al-Qaeda to demonstrate its relevance and strength, particularly after suffering significant setbacks in recent years, including the death of its leader, Osama bin Laden, and the decimation of its ranks in Pakistan's tribal regions. Al-Qaeda's North African and Yemen-based franchises have also announced their affiliation with the group when they were struggling for resources and exposure.\n\nThe merger has been met with mixed reactions in Syria, with some activists downplaying its significance, while others see it as a worrying development that could lead to a more extremist and brutal conflict. The Syrian government has seized on the merger to claim that the opposition is a foreign-backed terrorist plot.\n\nJabhat al-Nusra has been one of the most effective fighting forces in Syria, with thousands of disciplined fighters and a strong presence in rebel-held areas.

Top lawmakers showed vigor in cross-examining Kavanaugh and portraying him as President Trump's man on the court, potentially living up to expectations of the party's fired-up base ahead of the mid-term elections.\n\nThe hearing saw a bitter showdown between Democrats and Republicans over the handling of documents from Kavanaugh's tenure in the Bush White House. Some documents have been withheld altogether, while others have been provided to the committee on \"confidential\" terms, meaning senators can see them but they can't be made public. Democrats object that the confidential label has been applied to a wide swath of records, many of which contain no personal or sensitive information.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) released some of the confidential documents, drawing a stern rebuke from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who called them \"irresponsible and outrageous.\" However, it was later revealed that the documents had already been cleared for public release by Bush's attorney, William Burck, the night before.\n\nKavanaugh was pressed on his views on presidential power, with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) seeking a promise from him that he would be willing to serve as a check on the president who nominated him. Kavanaugh replied that \"no one is above the law\" and that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States is the final word in the system.\n\nKavanaugh was also questioned about his views on abortion, same-sex marriage, and immigration, but declined to answer, citing the need to maintain judicial independence.

Democrats have been chafing that too many of Kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the New York Times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when Kavanaugh was working in the White House of George W. Bush, he objects to language that Roe v. Wade is \"settled law.\" He was going over a draft opinion stating that \"it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" but he took exception to the phrase. \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" he wrote at the time.

Dylan Farrow, now 28, has accused her father of molesting her when she was seven years old, an allegation that has been denied by Woody Allen. The allegations were first made during a custody battle in 1993, and the case was investigated by the Connecticut State Police and Yale-New Haven Hospital. However, the investigation found no evidence to support the allegations, and Woody Allen was never charged with a crime.\n\nMoses Farrow, Dylan's brother, has now come forward to defend Woody Allen, accusing their mother, Mia Farrow, of poisoning the children against their father. Moses claims that their mother coached Dylan to make the allegations and that Dylan may not actually believe she was molested. Moses also accuses their mother of bullying him and other siblings.\n\nDylan has responded to her brother's comments, stating that her memories of the alleged abuse are real and that her mother never coached her to make false accusations. She claims that her mother was distraught when she first told her about the alleged abuse and that she has always told the truth.\n\nMia Farrow has declined to comment on Moses' accusations, but has tweeted that she will always protect her daughter and that the controversy is not about her, but about Dylan's truth.\n\nWoody Allen's family has also spoken out, with his sister Letty Aronson stating that the director is devastated by Dylan's letter and feels badly for her that she has been poisoned by her mother.\n\nThe controversy has been ongoing for over 20 years, with both sides presenting different versions of events. The case has been the subject of much speculation and debate, with some people believing that Woody Allen is guilty and others defending him.\n\nRobert B.

She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him.\" He goes on to say that on the day in question, everyone who was in the house was in public, and neither Woody nor Dylan ever went off privately. \"I don\u2019t know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother,\" Moses says, claiming that Mia Farrow often hit him when he was a child and went into rages if she was not obeyed. Moses is now estranged from his mother and many of his siblings, but is close to Allen and his wife, Moses' adopted half-sister Soon-Yi Previn. Moses calls the whole fiasco Mia's \"vengeful way to pay [Allen] back for falling in love with Soon-Yi.\" In a piece written last month, Allen documentarian Robert B. Weide noted that while Moses, 15 at the time Dylan accused Allen, initially refused contact with his father, he recently told Weide he's now \"finally seeing the reality\" of what happened and used the term \"brainwashing.\" Dylan was quick to respond to her brother's public change of heart: She tells People, \"My brother is dead to me,\" adding, \"My mother never coached me. She never planted false memories in my brain. My memories are mine. I remember them.\" She also denies her mother hit anyone.

Despite this, none of the players have faced any sanctions, and many of them will be competing in the Australian Open.\n\nThe investigation found that players are being targeted by corrupt gamblers in hotel rooms at major tournaments, who offer them sums of up to $50,000 to fix matches. The betting syndicates in Russia and Italy have made hundreds of thousands of pounds betting on matches, including at Wimbledon and the French Open.

However, the attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, and the government was able to regain control.\n\n**The Coup Attempt**\n\nThe coup began with a group of soldiers taking control of key locations, including the parliament building in Ankara and the headquarters of the Turkish intelligence agency.

However, a recent investigation by Politico has revealed that the deal was even more one-sided than initially thought. The seven men released by the US were not just \"civilians\" as portrayed by the Obama administration, but were actually accused of posing threats to national security, including being part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with US-made microelectronics for surface-to-air and cruise missiles.\n\nThe investigation found that the Obama administration dropped charges and international arrest warrants against 14 other men, all of whom were fugitives, and even dropped a demand for $10 million that a jury said an aerospace engineer illegally received from Tehran. The administration also removed Interpol red notices and dismissed charges against 14 Iranians for whom extradition requests were unlikely to be successful.\n\nOne of the prisoners released was Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who was central to Iran's pursuit of Western nuclear technology and had helped advance Iranian nuclear-centrifuge development dramatically. Another prisoner, Amin Ravan, was charged with smuggling US military antennas to Hong Kong and Singapore for use in Iran, and was also part of a procurement network providing Iran with high-tech components for IEDs that killed US military personnel in Iraq.\n\nThe investigation also found that the Obama administration had been slow-walking investigations into Iranian procurement networks operating in the US, and had even derailed its own National Counterproliferation Initiative, which was making progress in thwarting Iran's proliferation networks. The administration had also denied or delayed requests from prosecutors and agents to lure Iranian fugitives to friendly countries for arrest, and had slowed down efforts to extradite suspects already in custody overseas.\n\nThe investigation suggests that the Obama administration made a shrewd political calculation in focusing public attention on just the seven men it was freeing, and portraying them as mere sanctions violators. However, by letting so many men off the hook, and for such a wide range of offenses, Washington has effectively given its blessing to Iran's continuing defiance of international laws.\n\nThe Trump administration has pledged to crack down on Tehran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and a government-wide review of US policy toward Iran is underway.

The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn\u2019t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn\u2019t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors.

The 35-year-old California man was sentenced to more than 21 years in prison Friday after pleading guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to distribute drugs, reports the Washington Post. His fall from grace is a wild tale: While at USC in 2004, Hanson began selling drugs, including cocaine and steroids, Rolling Stone previously reported. After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy. Cipriani says Hanson threatened him and his wife, including by sending them a video of two men being beheaded. \"If you don't pay us our money, this will happen to you,\" an attached note read, according to prosecutors. The US gambler eventually went to the FBI and Hanson was arrested in 2015 in a joint operation with Australian police. He pleaded guilty in January, and has now been ordered to forfeit $5 million in assets.

The crisis was caused by the city of Flint's decision to switch its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which was not properly treated, leading to high levels of lead and other contaminants in the water. The crisis has had a devastating impact on the residents of Flint, particularly children, who have been exposed to lead and other toxins.\n\n**Investigation and Charges**\n\nMichigan Attorney General Bill Schuette has been leading an investigation into the crisis, and several individuals have been charged with crimes related to the crisis. In April 2016, three state and city employees were charged with felonies and misdemeanors, including Michael Glasgow, a city employee, and Stephen Busch and Michael Prysby, employees of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Glasgow pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge, while Busch and Prysby are still awaiting trial.\n\nIn July 2016, six more state employees were charged with felonies, including Liane Shekter-Smith, the former chief of the MDEQ's Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance, and Adam Rosenthal, a DEQ water quality analyst. The charges include misconduct in office, conspiracy, and willful neglect of duty. Shekter-Smith was fired from her position, while Rosenthal and the other employees have been suspended without pay.\n\n**Cover-up Allegations**\n\nThe investigation has revealed a cover-up of the crisis by state and local officials. Prosecutors allege that officials altered or concealed reports showing high levels of lead in Flint's water and the bloodstreams of the city's children. The reports were allegedly altered or buried to downplay the severity of the crisis and to avoid taking action to address the problem.\n\n**Civil Lawsuits**\n\nMore than 50 civil lawsuits have been filed since January related to the crisis. The state has also sued two companies, Veolia and Lockwood, Andrews and Newman, for their roles in the crisis. The lawsuits allege professional negligence, public nuisance, and fraud.\n\n**Current Status**\n\nThe city of Flint has switched back to the Lake Huron water supply, and the governor has declared a state of emergency.

MLive.com reports that all six were charged with misconduct in office, with willful neglect of duty and various conspiracy charges also being assigned. Schuette filed criminal charges in April against two other state employees and a city water utility official. In the Department of Health and Human Services, alleged transgressions include reliance on shoddy data and hiding or ignoring bloodstream test results that indicated the significant presence of lead. Within the Department of Environmental Quality, accusations include workers manipulating water monitoring reports, purposely \"misinterpreting\" federal drinking-water standards, and trying to mislead the EPA, as well as suggesting ways to keep an EPA expert quiet about concerns. Shekter-Smith, meanwhile, is said to have turned a blind eye as evidence of water contamination became clearer.

The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal\u2014but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one.

It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

A team of scientists at the University of T\u00fcbingen used a device that detects patterns in brain activity to enable patients with ALS to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions, and even express their emotions and opinions.\n\nThe study involved four patients, aged 24 to 76, who were diagnosed with CLIS, a condition that leaves people totally paralyzed but still aware and able to think. The patients were trained to use the system, which uses infrared light to spot variations in blood flow in different regions of the brain, to answer questions and express their thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe results showed that all four patients were able to communicate effectively with the system, with one patient even indicating that they were \"happy\" with life. The study's lead researcher, Niels Birbaumer, said that this is the first time that reliable communication has been established with CLIS patients, and that it is a significant breakthrough in the field.\n\nThe system uses a cap that detects changes in blood flow in the brain, which are then used to determine the patient's response to a question. The patients were asked a series of simple questions, such as \"Your husband's name is Joachim\" and \"Berlin is the capital of France,\" and were able to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" by thinking about the question.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that CLIS patients may not be as unhappy as previously thought, and that they may even experience a sense of happiness and contentment despite their physical limitations. Birbaumer believes that this could be due to the fact that patients with CLIS are able to focus on the positive interactions they have with their caregivers and loved ones, and may even experience a state of meditation due to their inability to feel or move their bodies.\n\nThe study's results have significant implications for the treatment and care of patients with CLIS, and could potentially lead to the development of more effective communication systems for these patients. Birbaumer is already working on a new project to develop a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked interest in the potential use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to communicate with other kinds of brain-injured patients, including those who are presumed to be in a vegetative state.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology.

For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"]}

The proposal\u2014titled \"America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again\"\u2014contains cuts that the Washington Post says could be the biggest reduction in federal programs since the post-World War II drawdown. The Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30%. Military spending would be beefed up by $54 billion under the proposal, $1.5 billion is earmarked for a border wall, and Homeland Security would get a 6.8% funding increase. A roundup of coverage about the $1.15 trillion spending plan: The document is here. Politico reports that the budget is \"red meat\" for Trump's base, with deep cuts to their most disliked government agencies and programs, though it is also what's known as a \"skinny budget\" because it is so short on details. A more detailed budget will be out in May. The AP lists winners and losers. The latter group includes the departments of Energy, Labor, and Transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the cuts would lead to job losses, Reuters reports. \"You can\u2019t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it,\" he said during a budget preview Wednesday. He said that White House officials had looked at Trump's campaign speeches, and \"turned those policies into numbers.\" The New York Times reports that congressional Republicans have already declared parts of the plan dead on arrival. \"The administration\u2019s budget isn\u2019t going to be the budget,\" Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters. \"We do the budget here. The administration makes recommendations, but Congress does budgets.\" The Hill notes that such proposals tend to be \"little more than guidance\" for lawmakers\u2014and that the Senate shot down Obama's 2015 budget 98 to 1. The AP reports that the budget funds Trump's boost for the Pentagon, the biggest since Ronald Reagan's, with cuts to conservative targets including the National Endowment for the Arts, legal aid for the poor, and the AmeriCorps national service program. NBC notes that Trump's proposal, which makes cuts to 12 out of 15 Cabinet agencies, only covers the \"discretionary\" quarter of the $4 trillion budget for the fiscal year that starts in October. The portion dealing with issues including taxation, Social Security, and Medicare is due in mid-May. The Washington Post reports that the budget proposal's elimination of funding for public broadcasting means that Big Bird's doom has been predicted once again, though public broadcasting has survived previous \"zero funding\" proposals all the way back to Richard Nixon."]}

The attack was carried out by a mob of protesters who were angry over an online film considered offensive to Islam. The film, titled \"Innocence of Muslims,\" was produced by a California filmmaker who identifies himself as both American and Israeli.\n\nThe attack on the consulate began with a protest outside the building, which was sparked by the film. However, US officials believe that the attack was planned in advance and was not a spontaneous reaction to the film. The attackers used the protest as a diversion to launch a coordinated assault on the consulate, which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nThe Libyan government condemned the attack and apologized to the United States for the loss of life. President Barack Obama ordered increased security to protect American diplomatic personnel around the world and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. The US Embassy in Cairo was also attacked by protesters, who climbed the walls of the embassy and pulled down the American flag.\n\nThe attack on the consulate in Benghazi was a tragic reminder of the lawlessness that has taken hold in Libya after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi's regime. The country is struggling to achieve stability, and Islamist groups have emerged as a powerful force. The attack was also a test for Egypt's new Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, who has yet to condemn the riot outside the US Embassy in Cairo.\n\nUS officials believe that the attack was carried out by ultraconservative Islamists, who have been responsible for a series of recent attacks in Libya. The group Ansar al-Shariah, or Supporters of Shariah, has claimed responsibility for the attacks on Sufi shrines and mosques in Libya.\n\nThe death of Ambassador Stevens was a shock to the US and the international community. He was a career diplomat who spoke Arabic and French and had already served two tours in Libya, including running the office in Benghazi during the revolt against Gadhafi. He was confirmed as ambassador to Libya by the Senate earlier this year.\n\nThe attack on the consulate in Benghazi has sparked a debate about the US response to the situation.

Weinstein's contract stipulated that he could only be terminated for a felony conviction involving moral turpitude or a major misuse of TWC funds. However, the contract contained a loophole that allowed Weinstein to refund the misused funds and remain employed.\n\n**The Code of Conduct**\n\nIn an effort to rein in Harvey Weinstein, the board introduced a \"Code of Conduct and Ethics\" that would apply to all senior officers and board members.

The scandal led to the indictment of two former members of Governor Chris Christie's inner circle, Bill Baroni and Bridget Kelly, and the guilty plea of David Wildstein, a Christie appointee at the Port Authority.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe scandal began on September 9, 2013, when two of three toll lanes for a local street entrance were closed during morning rush hour, causing significant traffic problems in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The closures were allegedly ordered by Wildstein, who was motivated by a desire to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for not endorsing Christie's re-election campaign.\n\n**Investigation and Charges**\n\nThe investigation into the scandal led to the indictment of Baroni and Kelly on charges of conspiracy, fraud, and civil rights violations. Wildstein pleaded guilty to his role in the scandal and testified against Baroni and Kelly. The trial of Baroni and Kelly is ongoing, with the government resting its case after 15 days and 18 witnesses.\n\n**Citizen's Complaint**\n\nA citizen's complaint was filed against Governor Chris Christie in Fort Lee Municipal Court, alleging that he knew about the lane closures and failed to stop them. The complaint was filed by William Brennan, a retired Teaneck firefighter and citizen activist, who alleges that Christie's failure to end the closures constitutes second-degree official misconduct. A judge in Bergen County ruled that there is probable cause to believe that an event of official misconduct was caused by Christie, and the case will now go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office to decide whether to bring an indictment against Christie.\n\n**Impact on Christie's Career**\n\nThe scandal has had a significant impact on Christie's career, with many experts believing that it contributed to his failed bid for the Republican nomination for President. Christie's approval ratings have also taken a hit, with a recent poll showing that 56% of New Jersey residents believe he should resign if it is proven that he approved of retaliation against an elected official who refused to support him.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe scandal has received substantial attention from the media, with many outlets covering the story in detail. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Record have all published extensive coverage of the scandal, and the story has been the subject of numerous TV news segments and opinion pieces.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Bridge", "answers": ["A citizen's official misconduct complaint against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie can move forward, a judge in the state ruled Thursday. Bill Brennan, whom the Star-Ledger describes as a \"citizen activist\" and Christie's office describes as \"a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,\" filed the complaint last month over the 2013 BridgeGate scandal. Per Brennan's complaint, Christie knew lane closures were happening and could have put a stop to the whole thing. The complaint is based on testimony from the trial against former Christie aide Bridget Anne Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni. During the trial, a man Christie appointed to Port Authority testified that both he and Baroni told Christie about the lane closures during a 9/11 ceremony (the lanes were closed from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13, 2013). Now that the judge has ruled the complaint can move forward, it will go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office so a decision can be made as to whether Christie should be indicted. Christie's office, which insists the governor had no knowledge of the lane closures while they were ongoing, said it would appeal the judge's ruling. The Star-Ledger reports that the courtroom audience, \"mostly there for minor criminal violations,\" applauded the judge's ruling. The judge issued a criminal summons for Christie, the New York Post reports."]}

The spacecraft, set to launch in July 2018, will venture closer to the sun than any previous mission, within 3.9 million miles of its surface. This historic mission aims to unlock the secrets of solar storms, which can impact satellites, power supplies, and even the Earth's power grid.\n\n**Honoring a Pioneering Scientist**\n\nEugene Parker, a 89-year-old astrophysicist, is being honored for his groundbreaking work on solar wind, which he predicted in 1958. The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate with an inscription of his choice. This is the first time NASA has named a spacecraft after a living individual.\n\n**Mission Objectives**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will:\n\n1. **Tracing the flow of energy** that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind.\n2. **Determine the structure and dynamics** of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind.\n3. **Explore mechanisms** that accelerate and transport energetic particles.\n\n**Innovative Design**\n\nThe spacecraft will rely on incredible feats of engineering, including a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit. The solar arrays will retract and extend as the spacecraft moves around the sun, keeping it at a safe temperature and powering it with the sun.\n\n**Impact on Space Weather Forecasting**\n\nThe findings from the Parker Solar Probe will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. This is crucial, as a solar event without warning could cause $2 trillion in damage in the United States and leave parts of the country without power for a year.\n\n**Launch Window**\n\nThe 20-day launch window opens on July 31, 2018. After testing the assembly, the spacecraft will arrive at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to prep for launch.\n\n**A New Era in Space Exploration**\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe marks a new era in space exploration, as it will venture into a region of space never before explored.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."]}

Many of the women reported that they were subjected to a \"boys' club\" culture, where they were excluded from social events and promotions, and were often assigned to remote areas with limited support.\n\nThe investigation also found that the agency's reporting process for harassment is often long and complicated, with many women reporting that they were discouraged from speaking out due to fear of retaliation. Some women reported that they were told that they would be \"blacklisted\" or that their careers would be ruined if they reported harassment.\n\nThe investigation led to the resignation of Forest Service Chief Tony Tooke, who was accused of having relationships with subordinates before becoming chief. Tooke wrote in an email to staff that he was stepping down to make way for a new leader, citing the need for a leader with \"moral authority\" to inspire employees.\n\nThe USDA has confirmed that it has engaged an independent investigator to look into claims about Tooke's behavior, and more than 45 women and men have come forward with their own stories about the agency.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "Multiple sources have revealed that former National Security Adviser Susan Rice requested the unmasking of the names of Trump transition officials who were caught up in incidental electronic surveillance. The unmasking occurred on dozens of occasions, with Rice requesting the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports that connected to the Donald Trump transition and campaign. The names of the Trump officials were then sent to top officials, including those at the National Security Council, the Defense Department, and the CIA.\n\nAccording to sources, Rice's requests were made in the months between Election Day and Donald Trump's inauguration, and the surveillance was legally authorized. However, the identities of U.S. citizens are typically masked in intelligence reports to protect their privacy. Rice's requests to unmask the names of Trump officials were unusual, as unmasking is typically done by intelligence or law-enforcement officials engaged in antiterror or espionage investigations.\n\nThe news has sparked controversy, with some questioning the motivations behind Rice's requests. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called out the media for not covering the story, saying it was \"interesting\" that they showed a lack of interest in the developments when it went in one direction. The story was largely ignored by ABC and NBC, while CBS defended Rice, with anchor Scott Pelley describing the surveillance as \"Obama-era surveillance\" and reporter Margaret Brennan playing defense for Rice.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has been investigating the matter, and his actions have been criticized by Democrats and the media. However, it has now been revealed that Nunes was onto something, and his actions were justified. The news has raised questions about the Obama Administration's use of domestic surveillance for political purposes and has sparked calls for Rice to testify under oath on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe story has also highlighted the double standard in the media's coverage of the Trump-Russia connection and the Obama Administration's alleged surveillance of Trump officials. While the media has been quick to run with stories about the Trump-Russia connection, they have largely ignored the allegations of Obama-era surveillance. The story has also raised concerns about the abuse of power and the need for congressional oversight of U.S. intelligence operations.\n\nIn related news, former Obama Deputy Secretary of Defense Evelyn Farkas was recorded saying that she was urging her colleagues to \"get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration.\" This statement has been seen as evidence of a broader effort to gather intelligence on the Trump transition team.\n\nThe story has also sparked a debate about the use of unmasking", "answers": ["Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice is back in the news again, this time regarding President Trump's wiretapping allegations.

Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed\u2014she didn't respond to the story\u2014but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president\u2019s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies.\""]}

The vote, scheduled for Sunday, is a result of a long-standing crisis that has been brewing since the mid-1990s. Greece's economy has been plagued by chronic deficit spending, which led to a massive debt burden that has been unsustainable since the country adopted the euro in 2001.\n\nIn 2010, Greece received a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU), but the rescue package failed to address the underlying issues, and the country's debt continued to grow. The IMF's analysis at the time was later found to be flawed, and the country's economy contracted, making it even harder to service its debt.\n\nThe current crisis began in 2015, when the Greek government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, refused to accept the terms of a new bailout package offered by the EU and the IMF. The government wanted to restore some of the spending cuts and reverse some of the revenue hikes that had been implemented, as well as seek debt forgiveness. However, the creditors, led by Germany and France, refused to budge, and the talks broke down.\n\nAs a result, Greece defaulted on a \u20ac1.55 billion loan to the IMF on June 29, and the European Central Bank (ECB) stopped providing emergency funding to Greek banks. The banks have been closed since then, and there are limits on cash withdrawals. The Greek government has been distributing IOUs to government employees, vendors, and pensioners to help them cope with the crisis.\n\nThe referendum on Sunday will ask voters to decide whether to accept the creditors' proposal or reject it. The \"yes\" vote would likely lead to a caretaker government and a continuation of the austerity measures, while a \"no\" vote would mean a sharp recession and a possible exit from the eurozone. The outcome of the referendum is uncertain, with polls showing a dead heat between the two sides.\n\nThe EU and the IMF have warned that a \"no\" vote would lead to a Greek exit from the eurozone, which would have far-reaching consequences for the country's economy and its citizens. The Greek government, on the other hand, argues that a \"no\" vote would strengthen its hand in negotiations with the creditors and allow it to secure a better deal.\n\nThe crisis has also had a significant impact on the Greek people, with many struggling to make ends meet.

The Washington Post has a primer on the financial reasons behind the vote, but a story in the New York Times casts it in more personal terms. It's largely become a referendum on Tsipras himself, and the story suggests that's why European leaders itching to get rid of him limited emergency funds to Greek banks this week. The move set off a panic among people scrambling for cash, and his popularity tumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t see how anybody can believe that the timing of this was coincidence,\u201d says a US economist. \u201cWhen you restrict the flow of cash enough to close the banks during the week of a referendum, this is a very deliberate move to scare people.\u201d Tsipras initially said he would step down if the \"yes\" vote prevails, but he has since backed down from that position."]}

The practice was based on a revelation from God, which stated that marriage could last beyond death and that eternal marriage was essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children. The revelation, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, was given to Joseph Smith in 1831, and it taught that marriage could be sealed for time and eternity, linking loved ones together for all eternity.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not widely accepted by early members of the Church, and it was met with controversy and opposition. However, many members eventually came to accept the practice after experiencing powerful spiritual experiences and receiving guidance from Church leaders. The practice was introduced incrementally, with participants being asked to keep their involvement confidential.\n\nIn Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith married multiple wives and authorized other members to practice plural marriage. The practice spread slowly, and by the time the Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, at least 196 men and 521 women had entered into plural marriages. Participants in these early plural marriages pledged to keep their involvement confidential, although they anticipated a time when the practice would be publicly acknowledged.\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not without its challenges, and it was difficult for all involved, including Joseph Smith's wife Emma. She approved of some of his plural marriages but likely did not know about all of them. The revelation on marriage required that a wife give her consent before her husband could enter into plural marriage, but Emma's rejection of the practice led Joseph to believe that he was exempt from the law of Sarah.\n\nThe decision to accept plural marriage was a trial of faith for many members, and it required earnest prayer and intense soul-searching. Some members experienced spiritual witness and peace after initially revolting against the practice, while others rejected it and left the Church. The practice of plural marriage did result in an increased number of children born to believing parents, and it was seen as a redemptive process of sacrifice and spiritual refinement.\n\nToday, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints no longer practices plural marriage, but it permits a man whose wife has died to be sealed to another woman when he remarries.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

Researchers at the University of New South Wales and Miami University conducted an experiment using the video game Halo 3, where they observed how male players treated female players. The study found that lower-skilled male players who were performing poorly in the game were more likely to make hostile comments towards female players, while higher-skilled players were more likely to be positive and supportive.\n\nThe researchers suggest that this behavior is driven by an evolutionary perspective, where lower-skilled males feel threatened by the presence of a female player and try to suppress her performance to maintain their social status. This is in line with the idea that men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status.\n\nThe study also found that higher-skilled males, who have less to fear from hierarchical reorganization, were more positive and supportive towards female players. This suggests that they may be trying to attract a female player as a potential mate.\n\nThe researchers argue that their findings have implications for understanding sexist behavior in online environments, where women are often subjected to harassment and abuse. They suggest that teaching young males that losing to the opposite sex is not socially debilitating may be a way to counter sexist attitudes.\n\nThe study's findings are supported by a previous study published in 2015, which also used the video game Halo 3 to examine the effects of performance and skill on male behavior towards female players.

The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

The court also ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require notice and a hearing prior to the imposition of corporal punishment in public schools.\n\nIn Alabama, corporal punishment is still legal in public schools, and many districts use it as a regular part of the discipline process.

According to recent reports, Iranian hackers infiltrated a small New York dam in 2013, and a similar breach occurred in 2012, where hackers gained access to the control system of a small dam less than 20 miles from New York City. These incidents are part of a larger pattern of cyberattacks on the US power grid, with hackers from countries such as Iran, Russia, and China targeting the grid's vulnerabilities.\n\nIn 2015, security researcher Brian Wallace discovered a breach involving Calpine Corp., a power producer with 82 plants operating in 18 states and Canada. The hackers gained access to user names and passwords, as well as detailed engineering drawings of power plants, which could have been used to shut down generating stations and cause a blackout. The breach was attributed to Iranian hackers, but the exact connection between the Iranian government and the individual hackers is unclear.\n\nThe US power grid is particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks due to its aging infrastructure and lack of security measures. Many substations and equipment are decades old and physically unable to handle electronic threats, and some run on outdated software that lacks malware protections. The grid's reliance on smart meters and other networked devices also creates fresh vulnerabilities, with some meters being easily hackable by plugging in an adapter that costs $30 on eBay.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has acknowledged the threat and has taken steps to improve the grid's cybersecurity, including holding briefings and providing training to energy companies. However, the full extent of the attacks on the grid is not public knowledge, and the DHS team responsible for responding to cyberattacks is hampered by government red tape.\n\nExperts warn that a cyberattack on the grid could have devastating consequences, including widespread blackouts, economic disruption, and even loss of life. The threat is not just from nation-state actors, but also from terrorist groups such as the Islamic State, which has been trying to hack American power companies.\n\nThe US government and energy companies are taking steps to improve the grid's cybersecurity, but the threat remains a growing concern.

US infrastructure is often run by creaky systems that were previously offline, which kept them relatively safe.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California, tracked the use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes among 5,490 California high school seniors who graduated between 1995 and 2014. The results show that while the number of high school seniors who reported smoking tobacco in the past 30 days has largely plateaued, the rate of teenagers using nicotine - either through tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes - is on the rise.\n\nThe study found that in 2014, about 14% of Southern California high school seniors said they had smoked or vaped in the last 30 days, which is similar to the 19% rate in 1995. This suggests that e-cigarettes have enticed an entirely new group of teenagers to use nicotine, rather than simply replacing cigarette smoking.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Pediatrics found that the prevalence of combined e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 was substantially higher than the prevalence of smoking in 2004, before e-cigarettes were available. The study also found that the combined prevalence of e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 was similar to or greater than that for cigarette use alone 10 to 15 years ago, before e-cigarettes were available.\n\nA third study published in the journal Pediatrics found that e-cigarette use in never-smoking youth may increase the risk of subsequent initiation of cigarettes and other combustible products during the transition to adulthood when the purchase of tobacco products becomes legal.

Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine (some don't), kids can get addicted. The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among Southern California teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 (19% to 9%), and slightly more in the decade after that (a bit less than 8% by 2014). But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14% in 2014. And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction,\" Barrington-Trimis says."]}

That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist?

The IG reviewed a \"limited sampling\" of her emails and found that four contained classified information. Clinton has denied sending classified information from her personal server, but the controversy has sparked a renewed investigation into her email practices.\n\n**Classification of Information**\n\nIn a related development, President Barack Obama issued an executive order in 2009 outlining the classification of national security information. The order establishes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information. It also sets out the criteria for original classification, including the need for an original classification authority to determine that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security.\n\n**Investigation and Response**\n\nThe controversy has sparked a renewed investigation into Clinton's email practices, with the Justice Department receiving a referral related to the potential compromise of classified information. Clinton has denied any wrongdoing and has released 500 pages of emails. However, the controversy has damaged her campaign, with some voters expressing distrust in her ability to handle sensitive information.\n\n**Republican Response**\n\nThe controversy has also sparked a strong response from Republicans, with House Speaker John Boehner calling on Clinton to relinquish her server and questioning her judgment.

This hemispheric specialization is characterized by the left brain being better at processing fast sounds and the right brain processing slow ones.\n\n**Mustached Bats**\n\nThe study, published in Frontiers of Neuroscience, reveals that mustached bats use the left hemisphere to distinguish communication sounds from each other, which have rapid changes in frequency. This is essential for their social behavior, as they need to communicate with other bats. On the other hand, the right hemisphere is used for sonar, which relies on detecting small changes in frequency, to track the velocity of fast-moving insects.\n\nThe researchers also found that this asymmetric sound processing is sex-dependent, with males having more asymmetry than females. This is consistent with humans, where women tend to use both hemispheres for language, while men largely use the left hemisphere.\n\n**Implications for Human Language Disorders**\n\nThe study's findings have implications for understanding certain human language disorders, such as aphasia.

Snooki's pregnancy is not an isolated incident, as many young, single women in the US are experiencing unplanned pregnancies.\n\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. FASDs can cause a range of problems, including abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing. The most severe form of the condition is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which can be caused by drinking more than four standard drinks per day during pregnancy.\n\nSnooki's pregnancy and career plans may be affected by her condition. As a reality TV star, she has built her name on her partying and antics, which may not be suitable for a new mother. However, she may be able to parlay her pregnancy into a media moment, as she has allegedly brokered a deal to announce her pregnancy on the cover of US Weekly.\n\nFASDs are preventable by avoiding alcohol during pregnancy. The US Surgeon General recommends that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy.

The search for Nakamoto has been ongoing, with several false leads and investigations by media outlets. Recently, two news outlets, Wired and Gizmodo, have identified Craig Steven Wright, an Australian computer expert and entrepreneur, as a likely creator of Bitcoin.\n\nWired reported that Wright's blog posts, leaked documents, and emails point to a connection between Wright and Nakamoto. The evidence includes a post on Wright's blog in August 2008, mentioning his intention to release a \"cryptocurrency paper,\" and a post in November 2008, requesting that readers encrypt their messages to him using a PGP public key linked to Nakamoto. Additionally, a leaked email from Wright to his lawyer in June 2008 references a paper called \"Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party\" that Wright expected to release in 2009.\n\nGizmodo also reported that Wright and Dave Kleiman, an American who died in 2013, were involved in the development of Bitcoin. A transcript of a 2014 meeting between Wright, lawyers, and tax officials quotes Wright as saying, \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009.\" Wright's statements and actions have raised suspicions that he may be Nakamoto.\n\nHowever, the evidence is not conclusive, and some have questioned the authenticity of the leaked documents and emails.

Wright has not commented on the reports, and his identity remains a mystery.\n\nThe revelation of Wright's possible connection to Nakamoto has significant implications for the Bitcoin community and the world at large. If Wright is indeed Nakamoto, it could mean that he has been hiding in plain sight, and his identity could have a major impact on the cryptocurrency's price and the intellectual history of cryptocurrencies.", "answers": ["Wired says it has uncovered \"the strongest evidence yet of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity.\" Nakamoto, the alias for the creator of Bitcoin, has never been unmasked publicly, but Wired's Andy Greenberg and Gwern Branwen name Australian Craig Wright, 44, as the most likely candidate. \"Either Wright invented Bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer,\" they write.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "**Hurricane Harvey and Climate Change: A Complex Issue**\n\nHurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston and surrounding areas, has raised questions about the role of climate change in intensifying the storm's impact. While scientists agree that climate change did not directly cause Harvey, they note that warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the future.\n\n**Funding the Recovery**\n\nThe cost of recovery from Harvey is expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars, and the issue of funding will test the nation's unity. In the past, Congress has faced partisan divides over funding for natural disasters, with some lawmakers demanding offsetting cuts in other programs. This approach has been criticized for undermining the core idea that government exists to help share risks that individuals and communities cannot reasonably bear alone.\n\n**Climate Change and Extreme Weather**\n\nClimate change is increasing the odds that storms will be more powerful and destructive. Scientists attribute this to warmer ocean waters, which are more conducive to intense hurricanes, and warmer air, which holds more moisture. While it is difficult to attribute any individual storm to climate change, the dominant scientific consensus is that climate change is a major factor in the increasing severity of disasters like Harvey.\n\n**The Politics of Climate Change**\n\nThe discussion of climate change has been politicized, with some politicians and media outlets downplaying its role in extreme weather events. However, climate scientists argue that it is irresponsible to leave climate change out of the story, as it is a major factor in the increasing severity of disasters. The politicization of climate change has led to a lack of serious discussion about the policy implications of the crisis, including the need for decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to a changing climate.\n\n**Adapting to Climate Change**\n\nAdapting to climate change is a complex issue, and some argue that it is a more pressing concern than mitigation. However, without mitigation, adaptation is a cruel joke, and the consequences of inaction will be severe. The rebuilding of cities and communities after disasters like Harvey will be a test case for adaptation, and it is essential to ensure that it is done in a wise and equitable way.\n\n**The Future of Climate Change**\n\nThe future of climate change is uncertain, but one thing is clear: it will have a profound impact on our lives and our planet. Climate change is part of every story now, and it is essential to find a way to weave the narratives of local and global impacts together while respecting and doing justice to both.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Climate change did not directly cause Harvey", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change\u2014particularly when talking about a single weather event\u2014the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."]}

The program, which has a long history of performing complex heart surgeries, has seen a decline in its performance over the years, with a significantly higher number of patient deaths and complications compared to other programs nationwide.\n\n**Poor Outcomes and High Mortality Rate**\n\nAccording to data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, the program's one-year survival rate for patients who received a new heart between 2014 and 2016 was only 85%, compared to 91.4% nationally. This means that twice as many patients died within a year as would have been expected, taking into account patient characteristics and illnesses.\n\n**Concerns Raised by Former Patients and Staff**\n\nSeveral former patients and staff members have come forward to express concerns about the program's performance and the quality of care provided. One patient's wife, Judy Kveton, received an anonymous letter in 2017 detailing the program's poor outcomes and the concerns of other physicians. Several doctors have also left the program in recent years, citing concerns about the program's performance and the lack of support from administrators.\n\n**Leadership Changes and Controversy**\n\nThe program's leadership has undergone significant changes in recent years, with Dr. Jeffrey Morgan taking over as surgical director in 2016. Morgan, who was relatively early in his career at the time, has been named in two malpractice lawsuits in Michigan, where he previously worked. The hospital has denied the allegations, but the cases have raised questions about Morgan's qualifications and experience.\n\n**Patient Care and Communication Issues**\n\nSeveral patients and their families have reported issues with communication and care during their hospital stays. One patient, Lee Lewis, suffered a series of complications after his heart transplant, including a malfunctioning artificial heart and a series of infections. His wife, Jennifer, reported feeling frustrated and uninformed about her husband's care, and expressed concerns about the hospital's communication and transparency.\n\n**Investigation and Response**\n\nThe hospital has responded to the investigation by stating that it has made changes to improve patient outcomes and that the program's performance has improved since Morgan's arrival. However, the hospital has also acknowledged that the program has struggled with high mortality rates and complications, and has taken steps to address these issues.\n\n**Call for Transparency and Accountability**\n\nThe investigation has raised concerns about the need", "answers": ["Baylor St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center is one of America's most storied hospitals when it comes to heart transplants. Or was. Though some of the first heart transplants took place at the Houston hospital, things have disintegrated to the point that it now \"has had some of the worst heart transplant outcomes in the country.\" So write Mike Hixenbaugh and Charles Ornstein in a story co-published by the Houston Chronicle and ProPublica. Their joint investigation found an elevated death and complication count for heart transplant patients there, whose one-year survival rate \"now ranks near the bottom nationally\" at 85% for those who got a new heart between mid-2014 and 2016; the national rate was 91.4%. Hixenbaugh and Ornstein add a face to those stats via the story of James \"Lee\" Lewis. Word came on Jan. 1, 2018, that St. Luke's had a heart for Lewis\u2014news that brought hope the 52-year-old would be able to walk his daughter down the aisle in June. But by March 23, he was dead, having never left the hospital. What happened in between is a series of missteps, starting with the Jan. 2 transplant. Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart. Then came strokes, infection in Lewis' bloodstream, and what the family says was another equipment mishap that left him brain-dead. Read the full story here."]}
