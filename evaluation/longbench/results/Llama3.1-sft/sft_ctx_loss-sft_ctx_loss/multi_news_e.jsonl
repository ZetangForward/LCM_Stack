The report, which took four years to complete and cost $40 million, details the CIA's use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists held in secret overseas prisons.\n\nThe CIA has been accused of monitoring Senate computers used by committee staff to prepare the report, which may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency. The monitoring has sparked a criminal referral to the Justice Department, which is investigating allegations of malfeasance at the CIA. The CIA has disputed some of the report's findings, and the White House has been closely tracking the dispute, but has not directly intervened.\n\nSenator Mark Udall, a champion of government transparency, has urged President Barack Obama to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the report.

These proteins bind to ice crystals and prevent them from growing, thereby preventing the fish from freezing over. However, a recent study has revealed a paradoxical consequence of this adaptation: the AFPs also inhibit the melting of ice crystals, leading to their accumulation in the fish's body.\n\nResearchers have found that the AFPs prevent ice crystals from melting even at temperatures above the expected melting point, a phenomenon known as \"superheating.\" This means that the fish are unable to rid themselves of the ice crystals, which can accumulate in their bodies over time. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the AFPs may be responsible for the fish's ability to survive in the cold waters, but also poses a risk to their health.\n\nThe researchers discovered that the ice crystals persist in the fish's bodies even after they are warmed to temperatures above the melting point, and that the AFPs are responsible for this phenomenon. The study also found that the ice crystals accumulate in the fish's spleens, which may be trying to filter them out of the blood to prevent them from causing problems in other parts of the body.\n\nThe study's lead author, Paul Cziko, notes that the AFPs work differently from traditional antifreeze agents, such as those used in windshield wiper fluid, which lower the freezing point of water. Instead, the AFPs bind to the ice crystals and alter their surface, making it difficult for them to grow or melt.\n\nThe discovery of superheating in nature is a significant finding, and it highlights the complex and often counterintuitive nature of evolutionary adaptations. Cziko notes that the study provides a better understanding of the progression of species and the potential costs of evolutionary innovations.\n\nThe long-term consequences of the AFPs' anti-melting effect on the fish's health are still unknown, but the study suggests that it may be a trade-off for their ability to survive in the cold waters. The research provides a fascinating insight into the intricate relationships between species and their environments, and highlights the importance of continued study into the complex mechanisms of evolution.", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice?

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "**Pacific Sardine Population Decline Threatens West Coast Ecosystem**\n\nThe Pacific sardine population, a crucial forage fish species, is experiencing a severe decline along the West Coast of North America. This decline has significant implications for the marine ecosystem, as sardines are a primary food source for numerous species, including seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has been urged to take action to protect the sardine population by setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on other forage fish species.\n\nThe current sardine population is at its lowest level in over a decade, with a November 2013 estimate of 378,000 tons, down from a peak of 1.5 million tons in 2000. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines. However, the exact cause of the decline is still unclear, and scientists are debating the role of overfishing versus ocean conditions.\n\nThe decline of sardines has already had a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, with brown pelicans, sea lions, and other predators struggling to find food. In 2013, over 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups washed up on beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego, with research suggesting that the scarcity of sardines was a contributing factor. The Pacific sardine is a boom-bust species, with populations fluctuating wildly in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment.\n\nIn response to the decline, the PFMC has implemented steep cuts in the amount of sardines that can be caught, but some environmental groups are calling for a complete halt to fishing. The value of sardines as forage fish is estimated to be twice as much when left in the water, at $11.3 billion, compared to their value as a commercial catch. The long-term consequences of the sardine decline are still unknown, but experts warn that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if the population does not recover soon.\n\n**Key Statistics:**\n\n* Current sardine population: 378,000 tons (down from 1.5 million tons in 2000)\n* Decline since 2006: 72%\n* Value of sardines", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment\u2014the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans\u2014which also depend on sardines for food\u2014are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)\u2014and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."]}

The study, which analyzed data from over 11,000 adults, found that while only 2% of the population currently follows a vegetarian or vegan diet, 10% have previously adopted these diets but have since reverted back to eating meat or animal products. This means that a staggering 84% of individuals who attempt to adopt a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle eventually give up.\n\nThe study identified several key factors that contribute to the high rate of lapsed vegetarians and vegans. These include:\n\n*   **Rapid transition**: Many individuals who transition to a vegetarian or vegan diet do so too quickly, with 65% of former vegetarians and vegans adopting their diet in just a few days or weeks.\n*   **Social pressures**: A third of former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarian or non-vegan partner, making it difficult to maintain their diet.\n*   **Difficulty in maintaining a \"pure diet\"**: 58% of former vegetarians and vegans found it too challenging to stick to a strict diet, leading to feelings of isolation and frustration.\n*   **Lack of social support**: Over 60% of former vegetarians and vegans disliked being different from their peers due to their diet, highlighting the importance of social connections and community support.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that a more effective approach to promoting vegetarian and vegan diets may be to focus on reduction rather than elimination of animal products.

With accusations that Get Hard is homophobic and racist, Ferrell defends the flick to the AP, noting he and costar Kevin Hart \"show a mirror to what's already existing out there.\" Do critics agree? \"Perhaps there's an edgy dark comedy to be made about race, class, and the prospect of facing prison, but Get Hard is not it,\" Claudia Puig writes at USA Today. The film's \"jokes are a cavalcade of racist and homophobic humorlessness.\" And though its cracks at class divisions perform better, they aren't worth the price of a movie ticket. Her advice: \"Unless you're really hard up for entertainment, stay away from this tone-deaf raunchfest.\" It \"seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts,\" writes Peter Howell more favorably at the Toronto Star. The film will undoubtedly offend a portion of the audience, but \"I enjoyed it because, unlike similar films of its ilk, everybody is in on the joke,\" he writes: white, black; rich, poor; etc. \"It's not great cinema, but it's also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity.\" And \"Ferrell and Hart make a good team.\" Cary Darling at DFW is less kind. \"Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the film's best moments, making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence,\" she writes. Excepting a scene in which Hart portrays a black guy, a Latino guy, and a gay black guy within a matter of minutes, the film just doesn't bring the laughs. Instead, it's \"weighed down by middle-school jokes.\" At its best, Get Hard \"does a smartly scathing job\" of attacking privilege and entitlement, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. At its worst, it \"veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize.\" Particularly, \"the movie is drenched in gay panic\" and includes \"tiresome 'don't drop the soap' jokes,\" based on Ferrell's character's fears about being raped in prison. At least \"Ferrell and Hart have a genial, easygoing chemistry,\" Hornaday writes."]}

This change aims to speed up the game, but not everyone is pleased with the decision.\n\nThe new rule, which was approved for the current season, eliminates the possibility of a batter scoring on an errant pitch during an intentional walk, as previously seen in instances where the pitcher threw the ball too close to the strike zone. However, some players and fans are nostalgic for the old method, citing the excitement of a botched intentional walk.\n\nThe change is expected to save around 35 seconds per game, which is a relatively small amount of time. According to MLB statistics, intentional walks took an estimated 1,410 minutes in 2016, which is equivalent to 35 seconds per game. The new rule is expected to reduce the number of intentional walks by a small margin, with 932 intentional walks issued in 2,427 games last season.\n\nSome fans and players are not convinced that the new rule will make a significant impact on the game's pace. One Twitter user suggested that the rule change is \"hardly worth it,\" while another joked that the new rule should be accompanied by a more exciting dugout signal, such as the \"Walk like an Egyptian\" dance.\n\nIn related news, MLB is considering further changes to speed up the game. The league is exploring ways to eliminate the four-pitch intentional walk altogether, with some suggesting that the pitcher should throw the ball from a distance of at least 300 feet. While the proposed rule change is still in the discussion phase, it is clear that MLB is committed to making the game faster and more exciting for fans.\n\nUltimately, the new intentional walk rule and potential future changes aim to enhance the fan experience and make the game more engaging.

This change could shave 14.3 seconds off of each game, per estimates by the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Post notes \"not everyone is thrilled\" with the change, including those who enjoy watching what happens when intentional-walk pitches go wild or batters go for them anyway.

According to the study, nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics are not needed, resulting in approximately 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from 2010 to 2011, found that about 13% of all outpatient visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of these prescriptions written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia. Alarmingly, half of these prescriptions are unnecessary, as they are for viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics.\n\nThe overuse of antibiotics has led to the rise of drug-resistant superbugs, posing a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. The CDC has warned that \"nightmare bacteria\" are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics, causing an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths every year in the United States.\n\nThe White House has set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020, which would require a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use. Based on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15% overall, resulting in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020.\n\nThe study highlights the need for better communication between healthcare providers and patients, as well as the importance of educating patients about the dangers of antibiotic overuse. Simple steps, such as displaying posters in patient waiting rooms, can help reduce antibiotic prescribing. The CDC and Pew Charitable Trusts are working together to combat antibiotic resistance and promote responsible antibiotic use.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* 13% of all outpatient visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription\n", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds.

And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2014the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post\u2014isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections\u2014meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"]}

The indictments, filed at the state court in Muenster, charge the men with being accessories to murder, alleging that they were aware of the killings that took place at the camp and willingly supported them in their roles as guards.\n\nThe two men, aged 93 and 92, served at the Stutthof camp, located near the Polish city of Gdansk, between 1942 and 1945. During this time, over 65,000 people died at the camp, with some being put to death in gas chambers or shot, while others died from malnutrition or froze to death. The men, who have not been named, deny any knowledge of the killings, but prosecutors believe they were aware of the atrocities and helped to facilitate them.\n\nThe indictments are part of a new approach by German prosecutors to pursue Nazi suspects who can be linked to the operation of concentration camps, even if they cannot be tied to specific crimes. This approach has been made possible by new legal guidance, which allows for the prosecution of former Nazis who helped to maintain the camps.\n\nOne of the survivors of the Stutthof camp, Judith Meisel, 88, from St. Louis Park, Minnesota, has been instrumental in bringing about the indictments. Meisel, who lost her mother in the gas chamber at the camp, identified one of the ex-guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted and beat prisoners. Meisel's testimony, along with that of other American survivors, has been crucial in challenging the defendants' denials of knowledge about the killings.\n\nMeisel's son, Michael Cohen, said that his mother is still unsure how she will respond to the charges, but is interested in seeing the case through. The trial is expected to commence next summer, and Meisel may be called to testify as a witness or observe the proceedings.\n\nThe indictments are seen as a significant step towards justice for the survivors of the Stutthof camp and their families.

She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible.

It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson.

Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was murdered on a street in Woolwich, south-east London, on Wednesday afternoon. The two suspects, Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were known to MI5 and had been under surveillance for eight years. Despite this, they were able to carry out the attack, which was filmed by a passer-by.\n\nThe suspects, who were shot and arrested by police, had been planning to ambush and murder the first police officers to arrive at the scene. A dramatic video obtained by the Daily Mirror shows the suspects, one wielding a cleaver and the other a handgun, charging at police officers. The footage reveals how the suspects had lured police to the scene by dragging the body of the murdered soldier into the middle of the road.\n\nThe attack has sparked a debate over how to confront extremism in Britain, which has spent significant resources on enhancing its security and counterterrorism network in the wake of the 2005 coordinated suicide attacks that left dozens dead and hundreds more injured. Prime Minister David Cameron has condemned the attack, saying that the perpetrators were trying to divide the nation, but that it would only bring people together and make them stronger.\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain has also condemned the attack, calling it a \"barbaric act that has no basis in Islam.\" The two suspects are currently under armed guard in separate London hospitals, where they are being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe investigation into the attack is ongoing, with police making two further arrests on Thursday, a 29-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, on suspicion of conspiring to murder. The police have also searched six residential addresses across London and in Lincolnshire, England.\n\nThe suspects' backgrounds have been revealed, with Michael Adebolajo, the 28-year-old suspect, being known to have converted to Islam a decade ago and being influenced by Western states' perceived abuses in Muslim countries.

The Ms. Foundation's original mission has been accomplished, and now it's time to take girls to the C-suite, where corporate chiefs work. The current state of women in leadership positions is a concern, with women making up only 3.6% of CEOs, 14% of executive officers, and 16% of board directors in Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe problem is not that girls don't know what a job looks like, but rather that they need encouragement to become leaders. Companies can help by introducing girls to female role models, making leadership more tangible by explaining the specific requirements and rewards, and supporting programs that actively identify and groom female talent. This can be achieved by highlighting the accomplishments of women in leadership positions and providing opportunities for girls to interact with them.\n\nResearch by the Girl Scouts found that 80% of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60% have not been offered the opportunity to see them in action at the workplace. Companies can use Take Our Children to Work Day to introduce girls to women at the highest level of the company, making leadership more visible and tangible.\n\nHowever, simply showing girls what an office looks like is no longer enough.

The legislation, known as the \"marriage for all\" bill, was passed by a majority of 329 to 229, with 10 deputies abstaining. The bill must now be passed by the Senate, the upper house of parliament, before it can become law.\n\nThe bill, a key election pledge of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, redefines marriage as a contract between two people, rather than between a man and a woman. If passed, it would make France the 12th country to allow same-sex marriage, joining countries such as Spain, Sweden, and South Africa.\n\nThe bill has been met with fierce opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and other conservative groups, who have accused President Hollande of pushing through the legislation without proper consultation. The Church has been a major force behind the opposition, with Cardinal Andre Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris, warning that the bill would \"rock the foundations of society\" and lead to discrimination between children.\n\nDespite the opposition, the bill has won the support of gay rights advocates, who see it as a major step forward for equality and human rights. The French gay, lesbian, and transgender rights group Inter-LGBT has hailed the bill as a \"major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights.\"\n\nThe vote comes as other countries are also grappling with the issue of same-sex marriage.

The church's decision was made after a two-year investigation by theologians who found no evidence of fraud or heresy.\n\nThe apparition is said to have instructed Brise to devote her life to teaching Catholic beliefs to children, which she did. The shrine, known as Our Lady of Good Help, has been a place of pilgrimage for locals and has seen a growing number of visitors since the church's decision. The bishop of the Diocese of Green Bay, David L. Ricken, said that the church's tradition is to take its time with such cases and that the decision was not influenced by the church's current scandals.\n\nThe Vatican gives primary responsibility for evaluating apparitions to local bishops, and the church is generally reluctant to investigate claims due to concerns about fraud.

This is a significant finding, as it suggests that homeowners with west-facing solar panels can reduce their peak energy usage by 65%, compared to 54% for south-facing panels.\n\nThe study's lead researcher, Brewster McCracken, explained that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy in the late afternoon, which coincides with the time when most people return home from work and turn on their air conditioning, increasing their energy usage. This means that homeowners with west-facing panels are optimizing their solar power generation at the exact time when their energy usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand.\n\nThe study's findings have the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market, as it opens up the possibility of installing solar panels on homes with east-west roof pitches, which were previously thought to be unsuitable for solar energy generation. Additionally, the study suggests that utility companies may need to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels, as they can help reduce the stress on the grid during peak demand periods.\n\nWhile the study's results are promising, it's essential to note that the study was conducted during the summer months, and it's unclear how the results would translate to other seasons.

Luis Vargas, 46, broke down when an LA Superior Court judge granted a petition to release him from his sentence of 55 years to life for three sex crimes. The move came after DNA evidence linked those assaults to a serial attacker known as the Teardrop Rapist, so labeled for having a teardrop tattoo under his eye, the AP notes. That man, who was never caught, is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the LA area. Vargas had matched assailant descriptions, and he caught investigators' eye because he had a faded teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a 1992 rape conviction involving his girlfriend at the time, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"You can sentence me to all the years you want, but ... that individual that really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there,\" Vargas warned a judge before he was sentenced in 1999. In 2012, Vargas reached out to the California Innocence Project and asked to use DNA techniques to examine samples on the clothing of one of his alleged victims, per the Times. The DNA matched that of the victim and the Teardrop Rapist. The three victims had positively IDed Vargas as the perpetrator, but an Innocence Project attorney tells the AP it was a \"shaky witness\" case, an assertion the LA district attorney's office backed up in a recent court letter that said there were discrepancies and uncertainties in their identification of the rapist, the Times notes.

The rover, which has been on Mars for almost a year and a half, has delivered its largest and most important findings to date, including evidence of an ancient Martian lake that could have supported life.\n\n**Ancient Lake on Mars**\n\nThe Curiosity rover has found evidence of a long and skinny freshwater lake that existed about 3.7 billion years ago in the Gale Crater. The lake, which was about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide, could have supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. The lake's calm waters and rich array of elements, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon, make it a potentially habitable environment.\n\n**Habitable Environment**\n\nThe discovery of the ancient lake confirms and extends the rover's previous findings, which showed that the Yellowknife Bay area was habitable billions of years ago. The lake's existence suggests that habitable environments were present on Mars more recently than previously thought. The rover's analysis of fine-grained sedimentary rocks, called mudstones, revealed clay minerals that formed in the sediments of the ancient lake.\n\n**Radiation on Mars**\n\nThe Curiosity rover has also made a significant discovery about the radiation on Mars. The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on the rover has measured the radiation levels on the Martian surface, which are high enough to be fatal to any microbial life on the surface or less than several meters deep. However, the team suggests that life could still survive on Mars today under special circumstances, such as in a protective atmosphere or in a dormant state.\n\n**Organic Compounds on Mars**\n\nThe rover has also searched for organic compounds, which are the building blocks of life, on Mars. While the search has been complicated and trying, the rover has identified several organic compounds, but their origin is unclear. The presence of a chlorine-based compound and an organic solvent has made it difficult to determine whether the compounds are Martian in origin.\n\n**Mars' Early History**\n\nThe Curiosity rover has also provided new insights into Mars' early history.

The first occurred when 19-year-old Nick Silvestri hopped up on the stage just before the start of Hand to God and plugged his phone into an outlet, not realizing it was a prop. He tells Playbill that it wasn't a joke and that he wasn't acting on a dare. He just needed to charge his iPhone. \"I saw the outlet and ran for it,\" he recalls. \"That was the only outlet I saw, so I thought, 'Why not?' I was thinking that they were probably going to plug something in there on the set, and I figured it wouldn't be a big deal if my phone was up there too.\" Security guards quickly moved in. After talking to Playbill, Silvestri even participated in a press conference and read a statement in which he apologized. \"I don't go to plays very much, and I didn't realize that the stage is considered off limits,\" he said, per Gothamist.

The snake was first discovered in 1936 by American naturalist William Beebe on the remote Mexican island of Clarion, one of the Revillagigedo Islands, located over 400 miles off Mexico's Pacific coast.\n\nAfter Beebe's initial discovery, subsequent visits to the island failed to find any more of the snakes, and the species was largely struck from taxonomic registries, with the existing dead sample assumed to be a labelling error. However, Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected that the snake might still exist and led an expedition to the island in May to search for it.\n\nUsing Beebe's original field notes as a guide, Mulcahy and his team, including Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute, successfully found 11 snakes matching Beebe's description. DNA analysis confirmed that the Clarion Nightsnake is a distinct species, closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast, over 500 miles away. The researchers believe that the snake's ancestors may have made the journey from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is significant not only because of its rarity but also because of the fragility of island ecosystems. The Revillagigedo Islands, where the snake is found, are home to a small detachment of Mexican marines and are subject to seasonal changes that can affect the island's biodiversity. The Socorro dove, another inhabitant of the islands, went extinct in its natural habitat in the 1970s, but live specimens were taken off the islands in the 1920s and re-introduced to the islands.\n\nThe National Museum of Natural History has recognized the Clarion Nightsnake as a full species, and researchers plan to continue monitoring the species to learn more about its role in the delicate Clarion Island ecosystem.

The tomb, which was believed to be a protected heritage site, was filled with concrete and topped with a new picnic table. An investigation is underway to determine how the mistake occurred, with officials citing a breakdown in communication between builders and local authorities.\n\nThis incident is not an isolated case, as ancient relics and monuments have been destroyed in various parts of the world due to a range of reasons. In 2007, a work crew in Nanjing, China, intentionally destroyed the burial sites of 10 noblemen from six dynasties. Similarly, an ancient Native American burial ground and village in California was discovered and razed last year to make way for multimillion-dollar homes.\n\nIn some cases, the destruction of ancient relics is not intentional, but rather a result of ignorance. In 2013, workers in Belize destroyed a 2,300-year-old Mayan pyramid while using its rubble for road repair, unaware that it was a Mayan ruin. This highlights the importance of proper communication and awareness among local authorities, builders, and archaeologists to prevent such incidents.\n\nThe preservation of ancient relics and monuments is a global issue that requires cooperation and vigilance.

The directive also contemplates the possible use of cyber actions inside the US, but specifies that no such domestic operations can be conducted without the prior order of the president, except in cases of emergency.\n\nThe directive has been met with concerns from security researchers and academics, who warn that large-scale cyber operations could easily escalate into full-scale military conflict. The US has already participated in at least one major cyber attack, the use of the Stuxnet computer worm targeted on Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges.\n\nThe directive comes as Obama is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in California, where cybersecurity and North Korea's nuclear threats are expected to be top issues.

The devices\u2014which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station\u2014will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours.

NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly.

Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"\u2014and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low\u2014but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")"]}

In an interview with GQ, Swift addressed claims that she is \"calculating\" and \"mean\" after Grizzly Bear's Edward Droste described her as such. Swift strongly disagreed, stating that she thinks about things before they happen, but that doesn't mean she is calculating. She also explained that she has a self-awareness that helps her navigate her career and personal life.\n\nSwift also discussed her song \"Bad Blood,\" which many people believe is about her feud with Katy Perry. However, Swift revealed that she never said the song was about a specific person, but rather about the loss of a friendship. She explained that she wanted to divert attention away from the easiest target, which was her ex-boyfriend, and instead make the song about a more universal theme.\n\nIn the same interview, Swift talked about her personal life and how it intertwines with her career. She revealed that she used to watch \"Behind the Music\" as a kid and learned that a lack of self-awareness can be a downfall for artists. She also discussed how she has a tendency to collect friendships and build a \"squad\" of high-profile friends, which some people see as self-serving.\n\nSwift also addressed her past feud with Kanye West, who famously crashed her VMAs speech in 2009. She revealed that she was hurt by the incident, but has since made amends with West and even presented him with the Video Vanguard trophy at the VMAs this summer.\n\nIn another interview with GQ, Swift talked about her experiences with loneliness and how she doesn't feel lonely despite being surrounded by people all the time. She explained that she has a lot of social stimulation from her meet-and-greets and concerts, and that she doesn't feel the need to be around other people when she's at home.\n\nOverall, Swift's interviews have shown that she is a self-aware and calculated artist who is in control of her career and personal life. She is not afraid to speak her mind and address criticisms head-on, and she is determined to preserve her self-awareness and maintain her creative vision.\n\nIn related news, a satirical article in GQ's Eye Roll Issue poked fun at Swift's calculated nature, suggesting that she is so calculating that she even tracks down her former acquaintances to correct them.

As for the rest of the GQ interview, Swift also discusses the rumor that her song \"Bad Blood\" is about Katy Perry (she basically fueled the rumor because she didn't want anyone to think the song was about one of her exes) and the VMAs moment when Kanye West stormed the stage and interrupted her acceptance speech. \"That was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career,\" she says. \"And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other\u2014that's one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.\" Click for the full piece."]}

The allegations span several decades, with over 20 women coming forward to claim that Cosby drugged and/or sexually assaulted them. The most recent allegations include a claim from Chloe Goins, a 24-year-old woman who says she was 18 years old when she was drugged and assaulted by Cosby at the Playboy Mansion in 2008. Goins claims that Cosby gave her a drink that made her feel dizzy and unsteady, and she woke up to find him licking and kissing her toes. She also alleges that he had his trousers down and was pleasuring himself.\n\nGoins' allegations are significant because they fall within the statute of limitations for filing criminal charges in California. The Los Angeles Police Department has opened an investigation into the allegations, and Goins plans to make a full statement to detectives.\n\nIn addition to Goins' allegations, another woman, Judy Huth, has also come forward to claim that Cosby sexually assaulted her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974, when she was 15 years old. Huth's lawsuit against Cosby is currently pending, and her lawyer has filed a sworn declaration stating that two witnesses have corroborated her story.\n\nCosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, has denied the allegations and has called them an extortion attempt. However, the sheer number of allegations against Cosby, combined with the corroborating evidence from witnesses and the fact that some of the allegations fall within the statute of limitations, has raised questions about Cosby's credibility and the severity of the allegations.\n\nThe allegations against Cosby have also led to a public backlash, with many people calling for him to be held accountable for his actions. Cosby's wife, Camille, has defended him, stating that he is the \"man you thought you knew.\" However, the allegations against Cosby have damaged his reputation and have led to a re-evaluation of his legacy.\n\nThe allegations against Cosby are not limited to the Playboy Mansion. Another woman, P.J. Masten, has claimed that she was given a drugged drink and raped by Cosby at the Playboy Club in Chicago in 1979. Masten believes that there may be other former Playboy Bunnies who are too ashamed to come forward with their own stories.\n\nThe allegations against Cosby have also led to a statement from Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy, who has distanced himself from Cosby and stated that he would never tolerate such behavior.

The filing doesn't offer specifics of what the witnesses know, the AP reports, but it does contain a psychologist's assessment that there's \"a reasonable basis to believe that Ms. Huth has been subject to childhood sexual abuse.\" Cosby, whose wife recently reacted to sex assault reports against him, isn't named in the psychological assessment. Meanwhile, yet another woman has come forward with allegations against Cosby, saying he drugged her at another Playboy Mansion party just six years ago, when she was 18. The timing means Cosby could still be criminally charged for the incident, the Hollywood Reporter notes. Chloe Goins plans to report the incident to police, the Daily Mail reports. She says she went to a party at the mansion, where she was introduced to Cosby, who gave her a drink, though she was underage. Feeling dizzy, she lay down in a room offered by Hugh Hefner, she says. Cosby allegedly guided her to the room, and when she woke up, she says, she was naked and he was licking her toes and masturbating. \"This isn't something I really wanted out there about myself,\" she says, but after so many women have come forward, \"I feel he needs to pay for it.\""]}

The contest has narrowed down to a three-way dead heat between Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, and Rick Santorum, according to the latest Iowa Poll. However, 41% of voters still have not made up their minds, indicating that the outcome is far from certain.\n\nRomney, the current front-runner, is banking on his electability as a key factor in his success. He has poured significant resources into Iowa and is expected to perform well, particularly in counties with high turnout. However, a poor showing could raise questions about his ability to win over the Republican base.\n\nRon Paul, on the other hand, is relying on his army of college activists and a strong ground game to propel him to victory. His campaign has been boosted by a surge in popularity, despite facing criticism for his past publication of a racist and anti-Semitic newsletter. Paul's message of liberty and limited government has resonated with many young voters and independents.\n\nRick Santorum, a Christian conservative from Pennsylvania, has seen a surge in popularity in recent days, particularly among social conservatives and evangelicals. He has raised more money in the last few days than in the previous few months and is expected to perform well in counties with high concentrations of Catholics.\n\nOther candidates, including Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, and Rick Perry, are struggling to gain traction. Gingrich has seen a significant decline in the polls and is facing criticism for his past support of global warming legislation and his lobbying work for Freddie Mac. Bachmann's campaign has been marred by infighting and a lack of organization, while Perry's campaign has been plagued by gaffes and a lack of momentum.\n\nThe outcome of the Iowa caucuses will have significant implications for the Republican nomination process. A win for Romney would all but secure his nomination, while a loss could raise questions about his electability. A victory for Paul or Santorum would be a major upset and could propel them to the forefront of the nomination process.\n\nIn terms of key counties to watch, Black Hawk County is expected to be a battleground between Romney and Bachmann, while Dallas County is a suburb of Des Moines that tends to have high turnout and has been a key battleground in previous elections.

The study, conducted by researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University, analyzed data from over 21,000 pregnancies and found that women who consumed two to four servings of potatoes or chips per week had a 27% higher risk of developing gestational diabetes. Those who ate more than five portions of potatoes or chips per week had a 50% higher risk.\n\nThe researchers propose that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grains may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes. They estimate that swapping two servings of potatoes per week for other vegetables, legumes, or whole grain foods could lower the risk by 9-12%.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Cuilin Zhang, suggests that women can reduce their risk of gestational diabetes by making simple swaps, such as switching from baked or mashed potatoes to sweet potatoes or boiled new potatoes, choosing whole grain bread instead of white bread, and opting for pasta or noodles instead of French fries.\n\nHowever, UK experts have cautioned that the study's findings are not conclusive and that more research is needed to confirm the association between potato consumption and gestational diabetes. They also note that potatoes are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and that moderate consumption is still fine.\n\nOther experts, such as Dr. Minisha Sood, director of inpatient diabetes at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agree that the study's findings are not surprising and that the Mediterranean-type diet, which emphasizes whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, has been shown to have benefits in terms of weight loss and insulin resistance.\n\nIn terms of alternatives to potatoes, Dr. Sood suggests that mashed cauliflower can be a satisfying substitute for mashed potatoes and is low on the glycemic index. She also recommends looking for healthier versions of potato chips, such as quinoa chips and lentil chips, which may have more fiber and be lower on the glycemic index.\n\nOverall, while the study's findings suggest that excessive potato consumption may increase the risk of gestational diabetes, moderate consumption is still fine, and women can reduce their risk by making simple swaps and choosing healthier alternatives.", "answers": ["If your short-term plan involves getting pregnant, your immediate plan should potentially be to lay off the potatoes. So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes\u2014which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies\u2014by 9% to 12%. As for why women should care, Zhang tells the BBC that women with gestational diabetes can develop pre-eclampsia and hypertension, which \"can adversely affect the fetus\" and put the mother at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

Around the one-minute mark, Flores raises his arms and the officers appear to fire at least two shots from about 10 yards away. Flores appears to slouch forward before falling to the ground. An officer approaches Flores' seemingly lifeless body 30 seconds later, grabs his arm, and drags him along the ground. An ambulance arrives just before the video ends. Police say they first tried to subdue Flores, 41, with a Taser and shield before shooting him, per the San Antonio Express-News. It isn't clear how many shots were fired or how many times Flores was hit. Police say the 20-minute encounter began when officers visited a home in the area to find a bleeding woman with a cut on her head, holding a baby who may have been injured, per KSAT. They say Flores, who had a criminal record, was there holding a knife. \"Certainly, what's in the video is a cause for concern,\" a sheriff tells the New York Daily News. \"But it's important to let the investigation go through its course.\" A district attorney agrees the video is \"troubling,\" telling KSAT, \"There's actually another video with a better view that is very close.\" He adds, \"There's a lot of information before, including 911 calls and information from different witnesses inside the house.\" On Facebook, Bexar County police slam KSAT for posting the video, calling the move \"unethical and sad\" and \"sensational behavior,\" noting it has resulted in \"physical threats toward our deputies.\" Vasquez and Sanchez are both on administrative leave."]}

Democrats have been chafing that too many of Kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the New York Times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when Kavanaugh was working in the White House of George W. Bush, he objects to language that Roe v. Wade is \"settled law.\" He was going over a draft opinion stating that \"it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" but he took exception to the phrase. \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" he wrote at the time.

Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia, has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, over the leaks.\n\nSnowden's revelations have sparked a heated debate about the U.S. government's collection of records of domestic telephone calls and overseas Internet activity in the global hunt for terrorists and criminals. The White House has welcomed a debate over the electronic surveillance programs, but some lawmakers have called Snowden's actions \"treason\" and questioned his access to government secrets.\n\nSnowden's actions have also brought together some liberals and conservatives to hail him as a hero. Liberal activist and filmmaker Michael Moore has called him \"HERO OF THE YEAR,\" while conservative commentator Glenn Beck has called him a \"patriot leaker\" who could help America \"regain her moral compass.\"\n\nThe U.S. government is building a case against Snowden, with FBI agents searching his home and computers and seeking interviews with his girlfriend, relatives, friends, and co-workers. A major question is whether Hong Kong, where Snowden fled, would extradite him to face charges in the United States. Hong Kong has a separate ruling system that allows a free press and tolerates political dissent, but its extradition treaty with the U.S. has exceptions for political crimes and cases when handing over a criminal suspect would harm the \"defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy\" of either party.\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has advised Snowden to go to Latin America, citing the region's tradition of asylum and human rights. Snowden has also been granted asylum in Iceland, but Icelandic law requires asylum applications to be made from inside the country.\n\nThe NSA's surveillance programs have been defended by some lawmakers, who point to their successes in disrupting plots and preventing terrorist attacks. However, others have raised concerns about the programs' impact on civil liberties and the potential for abuse.\n\nSnowden's revelations began with the publication of a top-secret court order demanding that Verizon Business Network Services turn over details of phone calls published from April 25 to July 19.

Hong Kong has an extradition treaty with the US, though Beijing maintains the right of veto over it, notes the Guardian, calling Snowden's move a \"high-stakes gamble\" that makes his fate \"a matter of political expediency.\" What's more, CNN adds that hotel costs will soon max out Snowden's limited funds.

The coup, which was led by a faction within the Turkish military, aimed to overthrow the democratically elected government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. However, the attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, and the government was able to regain control.\n\n**The Coup Attempt**\n\nThe coup began with a group of soldiers taking control of key locations, including the Bosphorus Bridge and the headquarters of the Turkish military. The soldiers also took control of state television and announced a countrywide curfew and martial law. However, the government was able to rally its supporters, and thousands of people took to the streets to protest against the coup.\n\n**Government Response**\n\nPresident Erdogan, who was on vacation at the time, returned to Istanbul and addressed the nation via a video call, urging people to take to the streets to support the government. The government also launched a crackdown on the military, detaining over 2,800 soldiers and arresting several high-ranking officials. The government also ordered the detention of nearly 3,000 prosecutors and judges suspected of having links to the G\u00fclen movement, a group led by Fethullah G\u00fclen, a US-based cleric who is accused of being behind the coup.\n\n**International Reaction**\n\nThe international community condemned the coup attempt, with many countries expressing support for the democratically elected government of Turkey.

However, a recent investigation by Politico has revealed that the deal was even more one-sided than initially thought. The seven men released by the US were not just \"civilians\" as portrayed by the Obama administration, but were actually accused of posing threats to national security, including being part of an illegal procurement network supplying Iran with US-made microelectronics for surface-to-air and cruise missiles.\n\nThe investigation found that the Obama administration had been slow-walking investigations into Iranian procurement networks operating in the US, and had even dropped charges and international arrest warrants against 14 other men, all of whom were fugitives. The administration had also dropped a demand for $10 million that a jury said an aerospace engineer had illegally received from Tehran.\n\nThe investigation also revealed that the Obama administration had been pressured by the White House to slow down investigations into Iranian procurement networks, with some officials describing it as an \"embargo\" on any Iran cases. This pressure was applied as far back as 2014, and was part of a broader effort to win support for the nuclear deal and prisoner swap from Tehran and Congress.\n\nThe investigation found that the Obama administration's decision to grant clemency to seven men in the US and drop charges against 14 others had undermined strategic enforcement efforts against Iranian procurement networks operating in the US. The networks had provided Tehran with a steady stream of critically important parts and technologies for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nThe investigation also revealed that the Obama administration had made a shrewd political calculation in focusing public attention on just the seven men it was freeing, and portraying them as mere sanctions violators. This allowed the administration to downplay the threats posed by the men and avoid controversy.\n\nThe fallout from the prisoner swap continues to reverberate through the Justice Department and the specialized units at the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and Commerce Department created to neutralize the threat posed by Iran's nuclear and military ambitions. The National Counterproliferation Initiative, created a decade ago, has suffered greatly, with many participants saying that critical momentum has been lost.\n\nThe Trump administration has pledged to crack down on Tehran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and a government-wide review of US policy toward Iran is underway.

The Obama White House released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own Justice Department. (They'd been accused of illegally shipping US macroelectronics to Tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles.) What's more, Politico found that the US also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including Seyed Abolfazl Shahab Jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for Iran by way of China. \"They didn\u2019t just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys,\" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells Politico. \"And then they didn\u2019t give a full story of it.\" In fact, Meyer writes, the White House actions \"derailed\" its own successful investigations into Iran's proliferation network, angering Justice Department prosecutors. A senior Obama official acknowledges that anger but says such compromises are necessary and pale in comparison to the greater good of a nuclear deal. Here's one sample of early reaction, from the conservative Hot Air site: \"Barack Obama and John Kerry desperately needed a win on foreign policy in 2015-6 after seeing its 'smart power' approach turn the Middle East and Caucasus into flames,\" writes Ed Morrissey. \"They didn\u2019t care if it was a short-term win that sacrificed long-term national security.\" Read the full Politico piece here."]}

His fall from grace is a wild tale: While at USC in 2004, Hanson began selling drugs, including cocaine and steroids, Rolling Stone previously reported. After college, he started working as a bookie in Los Angeles. Years later, his wife would tell a former boyfriend, professional gambler RJ Cipriani, that Hanson wanted to put up millions of dollars to fund his efforts at casinos in Australia, per 9 News. The money was to be returned with a casino check, though Cipriani could keep any winnings. Authorities say it was a scheme aimed at hiding money from Hanson's illegal dealings in Australia, where he could sell cocaine for ten times as much as in LA. Cipriani claims he figured this all out and was purposefully reckless at the casino tables to get out of the arrangement; he ended up losing $2.5 million. But his escape plan wasn't that easy.

Scott Walker, who says, \"I fully expect the leaders of South Carolina to debate this, but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones.\" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is trying to see both sides, saying he understands \"those who see a history of racial oppression and a history of slavery\" embedded in the flag, but that he also gets \"those who want to remember the sacrifices of their ancestors and the traditions of their states, not the racial oppression.\" Sen.

In a series of interviews, Ginsburg expressed her disapproval of Trump's campaign and policies, calling him a \"faker\" and stating that she cannot imagine what the country would be like with him as president.\n\nGinsburg's comments have sparked a firestorm of criticism from both the left and the right, with some accusing her of crossing the line and undermining the impartiality of the judiciary. Trump responded by calling on Ginsburg to resign, tweeting that she has \"embarrassed all\" with her comments and that her \"mind is shot.\"\n\nGinsburg's comments are unusual for a Supreme Court justice, who is expected to remain impartial and avoid making public statements about politics. However, Ginsburg has a history of speaking her mind and has been a vocal advocate for women's rights and social justice.\n\nThe controversy has raised questions about the ethics of Ginsburg's comments and whether she has compromised her impartiality as a judge. Some have argued that her comments were a necessary warning about the dangers of Trump's candidacy, while others have criticized her for overstepping her bounds.\n\nThe Code of Conduct for United States Judges, which governs the behavior of federal judges, prohibits judges from making public comments about politics and from engaging in activities that could be seen as partisan. While Ginsburg's comments may have been a breach of this code, they have also sparked a national conversation about the role of the judiciary in American politics.\n\nIn related news, the Code of Conduct for United States Judges has been updated to reflect changes in the law and to provide guidance for judges on issues such as recusal, financial disclosure, and extrajudicial activities. The code emphasizes the importance of maintaining the integrity and independence of the judiciary and provides rules for judges to follow in order to ensure that they remain impartial and avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nOverall, Ginsburg's comments have highlighted the challenges of balancing the need for judges to speak out on important issues with the need to maintain their impartiality and avoid compromising their integrity.", "answers": ["Ruth Bader Ginsburg would probably need something harder than a bottle of fine California wine to get her to vote for Donald Trump in November\u2014in fact, she doesn't even want to think about him as president, as she told the AP in an interview last week before piling on the Trump disparagement even further with the New York Times and CNN. The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige \u2026 to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal\u2014but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

A team of scientists from the University of T\u00fcbingen used a device that detects patterns in brain activity to enable patients with ALS to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions, and even express their emotions and opinions.\n\nThe study involved four patients, aged 24 to 76, who were diagnosed with CLIS, a condition that leaves people totally paralyzed but still aware and able to think. The patients were trained to use the system, which uses infrared light to spot variations in blood flow in different regions of the brain, to answer questions and express their thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe results showed that all four patients were able to communicate effectively with the system, with one patient even expressing happiness with life. The study's lead researcher, Niels Birbaumer, said that this is the first time that reliable communication has been established with CLIS patients, and that it is a significant breakthrough in the field.\n\nThe system uses a cap that detects changes in blood flow in the brain, which are then used to determine the patient's response to a question. The patients were asked a series of simple questions, such as \"Your husband's name is Joachim\" and \"Berlin is the capital of France,\" and were able to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" by thinking about the question.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that CLIS patients may not be as unhappy as previously thought, and that they may even experience a sense of happiness and contentment. Birbaumer believes that this could be due to the fact that patients with CLIS are able to focus on the positive interactions they have with their caregivers and family members, and that they may even experience a state of meditation due to their inability to feel or move their bodies.\n\nThe study's results have significant implications for the treatment and care of CLIS patients, and could potentially lead to the development of more effective communication systems for people with locked-in syndrome. Birbaumer is already working on a new project to develop a system that allows patients to communicate more proactively, rather than simply answering questions.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked interest in the potential use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to communicate with other kinds of brain-injured patients, including those who are presumed to be in a vegetative state.

In other words, they had \"locked-in syndrome,\" meaning total motor paralysis in spite of normal cognitive and emotional processing. Researchers at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany fitted the patients with caps through which they could observe changes in blood flow in different parts of the brain, they explain in the journal PLOS Biology. They first asked the patients to think yes or no in response to simple statements such as their spouse's name, and moved on to more personal questions when that was mastered. \u201cIt\u2019s the first sign that completely locked-in syndrome may be abolished forever, because with all of these patients, we can now ask them the most critical questions in life,\u201d says researcher Niels Birbaumer. The patients, all of whom are on ventilators and being cared for at home, range in age from 24 to 76. The team did stumble on a couple surprises. For instance, all four patients suggested they were \"happy\" with their lives in spite of being locked-in. (Birmbaumer suggests this might be because of something akin to meditation.) And one patient, who is 61, answered \"no\" nine times out of 10 when his 26-year-old daughter asked if she should marry her boyfriend Mario. \"But they got married,\" one of the researchers tells the BBC. \"Nothing can come between love.\" (Researchers can't explain how Stephen Hawking has lived this long.)"]}

The attack was carried out by a mob of protesters who were angry over an online film considered offensive to Islam. The film, titled \"Innocence of Muslims,\" was produced by a California filmmaker who identifies himself as both American and Israeli.\n\nThe attack on the consulate began with a protest outside the building, which was sparked by the film. The protesters, who were largely ultraconservative Islamists, fired guns and rocket-propelled grenades and set fire to the consulate. Ambassador Stevens and three American security guards were killed in the attack.\n\nThe Libyan government apologized to the United States for the attack, with interim President Mohammed el-Megarif condemning the violence and vowing to bring the culprits to justice.

In Egypt, protesters climbed the walls of the US Embassy in Cairo, pulling down the American flag and temporarily replacing it with a black Islamic banner.\n\nThe attack on the consulate in Benghazi has raised questions about the security of US diplomatic facilities in the region.

The problems began on Monday, September 9, 2013, when two of three toll lanes for a local street entrance were closed during morning rush hour. Local officials, emergency services, and the public were not notified of the lane closures, which Fort Lee declared a threat to public safety.\n\nThe resulting back-ups and gridlock on local streets ended only when the two lanes were reopened on Friday, September 13, 2013, by an order from Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye. Foye said that the \"hasty and ill-informed decision\" could have endangered lives and violated federal and state laws.\n\nIt was later suggested that the lanes had been closed to intentionally cause the massive traffic problem for political reasons, and especially theorized that they were a retribution attack against Fort Lee's Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who had not supported Christie as a candidate in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election.\n\nThe United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey Paul J.

The mission aims to get close to the sun's surface, within 4 million miles, to study the solar wind and the sun's corona. The spacecraft will travel through the sun's corona, experiencing temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, and will be protected by a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will study the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that flows from the sun out into space, and will help scientists understand how the sun's corona is heated to millions of degrees, while the surface remains relatively cool. The mission will also help improve space weather forecasting, which is crucial for protecting satellites and astronauts from solar radiation.\n\nThe spacecraft will make 24 close flybys of the sun, some of which will bring it within 3.7 million miles of the solar surface, and will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun. The mission will also carry a chip with photos of Eugene Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying his message to the sun.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a historic mission that will change our understanding of the sun and the solar system. It is the first time a spacecraft will be named for a living person, and it is a testament to the importance of Eugene Parker's work in founding a new field of science. The mission is scheduled to launch in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete.\n\nThe mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The findings from the mission will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will also help protect equipment from solar radiation, which can cause disruptions to satellites and power supplies. A solar event without warning could cause $2 trillion in damage in the United States and leave parts of the country without power for a year.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."]}

The two leaders met for the first time, marking a significant moment in the two countries' over half-century-long history of hostility. The summit was held at the Capella resort on Sentosa Island, and it was attended by a small group of officials from both sides.\n\n**Pre-Summit Developments**\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, Trump and Kim engaged in a series of tweets, with Trump defending his decision to meet with Kim and Kim showcasing his charm by strolling through Singapore's downtown area and posing for selfies with locals. Trump also tweeted about the summit, saying that he would know within minutes whether a deal could be made, and that the US had already achieved some successes, including the release of three American hostages and a halt in North Korean nuclear testing.\n\n**The Summit**\n\nThe summit began with a brief one-on-one meeting between Trump and Kim, followed by a larger meeting with aides from both sides. The two leaders exchanged signed documents pledging to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, but the details of the agreement were vague. Trump described the meeting as \"very, very good\" and said that he and Kim had developed a \"very special bond.\" Kim, for his part, said that he and Trump had \"decided to leave the past behind.\"\n\n**Criticism and Skepticism**\n\nThe summit was met with criticism and skepticism from some analysts, who questioned the pomp and ceremony surrounding the event and the lack of concrete details in the agreement. Some also expressed concern that the summit would legitimize Kim's regime and give him too much prestige. Others, however, saw the summit as a victory for North Korea diplomacy and a significant step towards peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe summit concluded with Trump and Kim shaking hands and exchanging smiles, and the two leaders are expected to meet again in the future. Trump also announced that he would invite Kim to the White House, and the two leaders agreed to work towards a comprehensive nuclear deal. However, the details of the agreement remain unclear, and many analysts are skeptical that Kim will agree to fully give up nuclear weapons.\n\n**International Reaction**\n\nThe summit was widely covered by international media, and world leaders offered their reactions to the event.

The initial greeting was a friendly one, with Trump grasping the arm of his fellow world leader during the handshake. (See the video.) \"We will have a terrific relationship,\" Trump told reporters shortly after the greeting, reports USA Today. Kim, for his part, said \"it has not been easy to get here,\" adding that \"the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles, but we have overcome them and we are here today,\" per the Guardian. After the ceremonial introduction, the two men met with only their interpreters in tow, then walked together along a balcony as they headed to a larger meeting with aides. Trump told reporters from the balcony that the meeting was \"very, very good\" and predicted he and Kim \"will solve a big problem, a big dilemma,\" reports the AP. It was difficult to hear the two men, but the AP adds that Kim appeared to agree with the optimism. White House officials have been downplaying the idea that a major breakthrough will result from the historic meeting on Sentosa Island. Instead, the big hope is that the summit will lead to a blueprint for negotiators from both countries to follow that would lead to denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

The vote, scheduled for Sunday, is a result of a long-standing crisis that has been brewing since the mid-1990s. Greece's economy has been plagued by chronic deficit spending, which led to a massive debt burden that has been unsustainable since the country adopted the euro in 2001.\n\nIn 2010, Greece received a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but the rescue package failed to address the underlying issues, and the country's debt continued to grow. The IMF's analysis at the time was later found to be flawed, and the country's economy contracted, making it even harder to service its debt.\n\nThe current crisis began in 2015, when the Greek government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, refused to accept the terms of a new bailout package offered by the EU and the IMF. The government wanted to restore some of the spending cuts and reverse some of the revenue hikes that had been implemented, as well as seek debt forgiveness. However, the creditors, led by Germany and France, refused to budge, and the negotiations broke down.\n\nThe Greek government then called a referendum, asking voters to decide whether to accept the creditors' terms or reject them. The referendum is seen as a test of the government's popularity and its ability to negotiate a better deal with the creditors. The outcome of the vote is uncertain, with polls showing a dead heat between the \"yes\" and \"no\" camps.\n\nThe Greek economy is already suffering, with banks closed and limits imposed on cash withdrawals. The country's debt is unsustainable, and the IMF has warned that Greece needs an additional \u20ac50 billion over the next three years to stabilize its finances. The European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the IMF have all warned that a \"no\" vote could lead to Greece's exit from the eurozone.\n\nThe referendum has sparked a heated debate in Greece, with both sides making passionate appeals to voters. The \"no\" camp, led by Tsipras, argues that a \"no\" vote will strengthen the government's hand in negotiations and allow it to secure a better deal with the creditors. The \"yes\" camp, on the other hand, argues that a \"yes\" vote will bring a caretaker government and a chance to start anew.\n\nThe outcome of the referendum will have far-reaching consequences for Greece and the European Union. If Greece votes \"no,\"", "answers": ["Greece's top court has declared that Sunday's referendum on a bailout is constitutional, meaning the vote with huge implications for all of Europe will proceed.

Instead, he said, the referendum is about giving him more leverage to get a better deal from creditors. It's the only way Greece can \"live with dignity in Europe,\" he said, per the BBC. The Washington Post has a primer on the financial reasons behind the vote, but a story in the New York Times casts it in more personal terms. It's largely become a referendum on Tsipras himself, and the story suggests that's why European leaders itching to get rid of him limited emergency funds to Greek banks this week. The move set off a panic among people scrambling for cash, and his popularity tumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t see how anybody can believe that the timing of this was coincidence,\u201d says a US economist. \u201cWhen you restrict the flow of cash enough to close the banks during the week of a referendum, this is a very deliberate move to scare people.\u201d Tsipras initially said he would step down if the \"yes\" vote prevails, but he has since backed down from that position."]}

Thad Cochran took place on November 27, 2018. The election was a runoff between Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, a former Secretary of Agriculture under President Bill Clinton. The election was seen as a crucial test for both parties, with the outcome determining the balance of power in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHyde-Smith, who was appointed to the Senate in April, was initially expected to win the election, but her campaign was marred by controversy over a video that showed her praising a supporter by saying, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.\" The comment sparked outrage in a state with a history of racism and violence against blacks, including lynchings. Several businesses, including Walmart, demanded that Hyde-Smith return their donations after the comment.\n\nDespite the controversy, Hyde-Smith's campaign was able to depict Espy as too liberal for Mississippi, a state that has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1982. Hyde-Smith also received support from President Donald Trump, who attended two get-out-the-vote rallies in the state on Monday and tweeted his congratulations to her after the race was called.\n\nEspy, who campaigned as a moderate who would work with Trump and Republicans to benefit the state, tried to recreate the coalition that propelled Democrat Doug Jones to a Senate win in neighboring Alabama last year by energizing black voters, particularly women, and winning support from white swing voters. However, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and Hyde-Smith won the election by nearly 8 percentage points.\n\nThe outcome of the election means that Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the new U.S. Senate that convenes in January. Hyde-Smith's victory was seen as a significant win for the Republican Party, which had been concerned about the potential for an upset in a state that Trump won by 18 percentage points in 2016.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, both parties made a push to mobilize their supporters. Trump's visits to Mississippi on Monday were seen as a bid to rally the Republican base to vote in an election taking place two days after the Thanksgiving weekend.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "The practice of plural marriage, also known as polygamy, was a significant aspect of the early history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The practice was introduced by Joseph Smith, the founder of the church, in the 1840s, and it was practiced by some members of the church for over 50 years.\n\nAccording to the church's doctrine, monogamy is the Lord's standing law of marriage, but in biblical times, the Lord commanded some of His people to practice plural marriage. Joseph Smith received a revelation in 1831, which led to the practice of plural marriage being introduced among the early Saints. The revelation stated that the practice was to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant and to \"raise up seed unto [the Lord].\"\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not without its challenges. Many early members of the church were hesitant to accept the practice, but after receiving spiritual experiences and testimonies, they came to accept it as a commandment from God. The practice was introduced incrementally, and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential, anticipating a time when the practice would be publicly acknowledged.\n\nIn Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith married multiple wives and authorized other members of the church to practice plural marriage. The practice spread slowly, and by the time the Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, at least 196 men and 521 women had entered into plural marriages. Participants in these early plural marriages pledged to keep their involvement confidential, but rumors spread, and some men unscrupulously used these rumors to seduce women into unauthorized practices.\n\nJoseph Smith's wife, Emma, was initially opposed to plural marriage, but she eventually approved of some of his plural marriages. However, she may not have known about all of his sealings. The revelation on marriage, which was dictated by Joseph Smith in 1843, required that a wife give her consent before her husband could enter into plural marriage, but it also stated that if the first wife \"receive not this law,\" the husband would be \"exempt from the law of Sarah.\"\n\nThe practice of plural marriage was not without its trials and spiritual witnesses. Some Saints saw plural marriage as a redemptive process of sacrifice and spiritual refinement, while others rejected the principle and left the church. However, for many women and men, initial revulsion and anguish was followed by struggle, resolution, and ultimately, light and peace.\n\nIn 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff", "answers": ["The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled \"Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \"careful estimates\" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the \"biggest bombshell for some.\" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed \"for eternity alone,\" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were \"for time and eternity\"). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \"wrenching trial\" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that \"the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.\" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \"reliable, faith-promoting\" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

Drudge also linked to an analysis in the Washington Post headlined, \"Ted Cruz\u2019s war with Matt Drudge could become a huge problem for his campaign.\" In that piece, James Hohmann writes that a \"word cloud\" from social media shows that Drudge is making an impact, with the words \"cheating\" and \"drudge\" showing up among mentions of Cruz's Colorado win. This should worry Cruz because it could make his victories seem illegitimate to conservatives. \"If Cruz wins the nomination at a contested convention in Cleveland, he will need these grass-roots activists to rally around him,\" writes Hohmann. \"If regular Drudge readers believe he did not win fair and square, they will be less inclined to do so.\" A blogger at the American Spectator, meanwhile, dismisses the \"reprehensible\" coverage on Drudge as \"cheap tabloid tricks.\" Trump is looking for a \"distraction\" from the reality that he was beaten soundly in Colorado, where the rules were clear, writes Ross Kaminsky."]}

Researchers from the University of New South Wales and Miami University conducted an experiment using the online video game Halo 3, where they observed how male players treated female players. The study found that lower-skilled male players who were performing poorly in the game were more likely to make hostile comments towards female players, while higher-skilled players were more likely to be positive and supportive.\n\nThe researchers suggest that this behavior is driven by an evolutionary perspective, where lower-skilled males feel threatened by the presence of a female player and try to suppress her performance to maintain their social status. This is in line with the idea that men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status.\n\nThe study also found that higher-skilled males, who have less to fear from hierarchical reorganization, were more positive and supportive towards female players. This suggests that they may be trying to attract a female player as a potential mate.\n\nThe researchers argue that their findings have implications for understanding sexist behavior in online environments, where women are often subjected to harassment and abuse. They suggest that teaching young males that losing to the opposite sex is not socially debilitating may be a way to counter sexist attitudes.\n\nThe study's findings are supported by a previous study published in the journal PLOS One, which found that men who were less skilled at the game and performing poorly were more likely to make hostile comments towards female players. The study also found that men who were more skilled and performing well were more likely to be positive and supportive towards female players.\n\nThe researchers suggest that their findings have implications for understanding sexist behavior in online environments, where women are often subjected to harassment and abuse.

Scientists who conducted the study published in Plos One played 163 games of Halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players (82 female, 81 male) with remote teammates and opponents. The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

The court held that the common law privilege permitting teachers to inflict reasonable corporal punishment on children in their care is sufficient to protect students from excessive punishment. The court also ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require notice and a hearing prior to the imposition of corporal punishment in public schools.\n\nIn Alabama, corporal punishment is still legal in public schools, and many districts use it as a regular part of the discipline process.

The data also showed that black males were more likely to be paddled than white males, and black girls were paddled at even more disproportionate rates.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents be encouraged and assisted in the development of methods other than spanking for managing undesired behavior. The academy suggests that effective discipline requires three essential components: a positive, supportive, loving relationship between the parent(s) and child, use of positive reinforcement strategies to increase desired behaviors, and removing reinforcement or applying punishment to reduce or eliminate undesired behaviors.\n\nIn contrast, many countries have outlawed the use of corporal punishment in schools and homes. The Global Initiative to End Corporal Punishment reports that 49 nations have banned corporal punishment, including most of Europe and South America.

The state superintendent, Michael Sentance, has not commented on the issue. The Alabama Education Association has not called for a ban on paddling, and the state's numbers on corporal punishment have shown a long-term downward trend, with the number of students paddled decreasing from nearly 40,000 in 2000 to below 20,000 in the latest data.\n\nThe use of alternative strategies, such as positive behavioral intervention supports (PBIS), is showing promise in reducing the need for corporal punishment", "answers": ["An old-school form of discipline remains popular in Alabama.

The hackers, believed to be from Iran, stole sensitive information, including engineering drawings of power plants and user names and passwords, which could be used to shut down generating stations and cause a blackout.\n\nThe attacks are part of a larger pattern of cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, with hackers from Russia, China, and other countries also targeting the grid. The Department of Homeland Security has warned that hackers from these countries are testing U.S. critical infrastructure networks for vulnerabilities. In 2015, the Department of Homeland Security responded to 295 hacking incidents related to industrial controls, up from 245 the previous year.\n\nThe consequences of a cyberattack on the power grid could be devastating, with a blackout across 15 states and Washington, D.C. potentially costing the economy hundreds of billions and raising mortality rates at hospitals. Experts say utilities are unprepared to cope with the threat of such an attack, with much of the technology governing industrial systems being outdated and connected directly to at-risk office networks.\n\nThe U.S. has more than 57,000 industrial-control systems connected to the Internet, and the Department of Homeland Security has issued repeated public warnings to utilities that their networks are at risk.

Lawmakers have called for clear standards governing the U.S. response to different incidents.\n\nThe AP investigation found that about a dozen times in the last decade, sophisticated foreign hackers have gained enough remote access to control the operations networks that keep the lights on. The public almost never learns the details about these types of attacks, and information about the government's response to these hacks is often protected and sometimes classified.\n\nThe grid is largely privately owned and has entire sections that fall outside federal regulation, leaving the industry poorly defended against a growing universe of hackers seeking to access its networks.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California, tracked the use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes among 5,490 California high school seniors who graduated between 1995 and 2014. The results show that while the number of high school seniors who reported smoking tobacco in the past 30 days has largely plateaued, the rate of teenagers using nicotine - either through tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes - is on the rise.\n\nThe study found that in 2014, about 14% of Southern California high school seniors said they had smoked or vaped in the last 30 days, which is similar to the 19% rate in 1995. This suggests that e-cigarettes are not just replacing traditional tobacco products, but rather enticing an entirely new group of teenagers to use nicotine.\n\nThe study's lead author, Jessica Barrington-Trimis, said that the data suggest that e-cigarettes are not just a substitute for cigarettes, but rather a new way for teenagers to get hooked on nicotine. \"Kids are not just using e-cigarettes instead of cigarettes,\" she said. \"That is what we were frankly hoping to find.\"\n\nAnother study published in the journal Pediatrics found that e-cigarette use among adolescents is a gateway to traditional tobacco products. The study, which followed a cohort of adolescents in Southern California, found that adolescents who vape are six times more likely to smoke cigarettes in early adulthood than nonusers.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also reported that e-cigarette use among high school students has increased exponentially in recent years, with 16% of high school students reporting past 30-day use of e-cigarettes in 2015, compared to 1.1% in 2011.\n\nThe e-cigarette industry has grown rapidly in recent years, with the number of teens and tweens using these products doubling between 2011 and 2012.

Another USC study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \"E-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use,\" says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine (some don't), kids can get addicted. The New York Times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; WebMD adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from USC's Children's Health Study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use.

But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14% in 2014. And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \"E-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction,\" Barrington-Trimis says."]}

The fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, denied the assault and claimed that there was no \"date function or formal event\" on the night in question. Jackie herself is now unsure if the man she says lured her into the room where the rape occurred was a Phi Psi brother.\n\nRolling Stone has since apologized for not contacting the alleged assaulters to get their account, citing a desire to be sensitive to the victim's feelings. However, the magazine has come to realize that this decision was a mistake and that they should have worked harder to get the other side of the story.\n\nThe article has sparked a wave of outrage and calls for action on campus.

The NIC has opposed proposals at dozens of colleges to delay recruitment by a semester or a year, arguing that it would unfairly restrict the freedom of association of fraternity members.\n\nThe article cites the case of California Polytechnic State University, which banned fraternities from recruiting freshmen after a student died from excessive drinking during an initiation ritual. However, the NIC worked with students and administrators to lift the ban, and the university now allows fraternities to recruit freshmen immediately.\n\nThe article also reports on the issue of binge drinking and hazing in fraternities, with some experts arguing that delaying recruitment could help reduce the risk of these problems. However, the NIC and other fraternity leaders argue that delaying recruitment would not address the underlying issues and would deprive freshmen of the benefits of fraternity membership.\n\nThe second article reports on the history of fraternities in the United States, from their origins in the early 19th century to the present day.

She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University\u2014and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow\u2014so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities.

The rebuttal, written by Patriots lawyer Daniel L.

The rebuttal also disputes the interpretation of text messages between team employees Jim McNally and John Jastremski, which the Wells Report claimed were evidence of a scheme to deflate footballs.\n\nThe rebuttal also cites the conclusions of Nobel laureate Roderick MacKinnon, who rejected the Wells Report's scientific evidence and found that the pressure of the Patriots' footballs was consistent with the Ideal Gas Law. The rebuttal also points out that the League's lawyers made several assumptions about the timing of events at halftime, which were not supported by evidence.\n\nThe Patriots have also appealed Brady's four-game suspension, which was announced by the NFL on Monday. The suspension was part of a package of penalties that also included a $1 million fine and the loss of two draft picks. The appeal only deals with the suspension and must be heard within 10 days.\n\nThe NFL's investigation into the deflated footballs was sparked by a complaint from the Indianapolis Colts, who raised concerns about the air pressure of the Patriots' footballs before the AFC Championship game.

A study published in Frontiers of Neuroscience found that mustached bats use the left and right sides of their brains to process different aspects of sounds, similar to humans. This hemispheric specialization is characterized by the left brain's ability to process fast sounds and the right brain's ability to process slow sounds.\n\n**Mustached Bats' Unique Brain Structure**\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers from Georgetown University Medical Center and American University, used a combination of neurophysiological and behavioral techniques to investigate the brain's sound processing abilities in mustached bats. The results showed that the bats' brains are capable of processing complex sounds, including communication calls and biosonar signals, using both the left and right hemispheres. This is a unique feature of the mustached bat's brain, as no other animal studied to date has demonstrated such hemispheric specialization.\n\n**Implications for Human Language Disorders**\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for understanding human language disorders, such as aphasia. The researchers suggest that the asymmetric sound processing in bats may be a key factor in the development of language disorders, and that studying bat brains may provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying these disorders.\n\n**Evolutionary Significance**\n\nThe study's senior author, Stuart Washington, PhD, notes that the findings of asymmetrical sound processing in both human and bat brains make evolutionary sense. The slower timing of the right hemisphere may allow us to identify who is speaking, gauge their emotional state, and tease out pitch in music, which is thought to be important for getting groups of people to coordinate their activities and can ultimately lead to the formation of cultures.\n\n**Sex-Dependent Asymmetry**\n\nThe study also found that the asymmetry in sound processing is sex-dependent, with males having more asymmetry than females. This is consistent with humans, where women tend to use both the left and right hemispheres for language, but men largely use just the left hemisphere.\n\n**Future Research Directions**\n\nThe study's findings open up new avenues for research into the neural mechanisms underlying hemispheric specialization in mustached bats and humans.

In both humans and Parnell's mustached bats\u2014a species that lives in an area ranging from Mexico to Brazil, RedOrbit reports\u2014the left hemisphere handles quicker sounds, while the right deals with slower ones, a press release reports.

In mustached bats\u2014named based on the hair springing from the sides of their snouts, Animal Diversity Web explains\u2014the right hemisphere's slower processing is used for sonar, \"which relies on detecting small changes in frequency,\" says Washington, senior author of the study in Frontiers in Neuroscience.

The search for Nakamoto has been ongoing, with several false leads and investigations by media outlets. Recently, two news outlets, Wired and Gizmodo, have identified Craig Steven Wright, an Australian computer expert and entrepreneur, as a likely creator of Bitcoin.\n\nWired obtained a trove of evidence, including leaked documents and emails, that point to Wright as Nakamoto. The evidence includes blog posts from Wright's website, which mention his intention to release a \"cryptocurrency paper\" and reference \"triple entry accounting,\" a concept similar to Bitcoin. Additionally, a leaked email from Wright to his lawyer in 2008 mentions a \"P2P distributed ledger,\" which is similar to Bitcoin's blockchain.\n\nGizmodo also reported that Wright and Dave Kleiman, an American who died in 2013, were involved in the development of Bitcoin. A transcript of a 2014 meeting between Wright, lawyers, and tax officials quotes Wright as saying, \"I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009.\" Wright also mentioned that he thinks \"half the world is going to bloody know\" about his involvement with Bitcoin.\n\nWright's background and credentials match those of Nakamoto, including his expertise in computer science, cryptography, and economics. He is also a former subscriber to the \"cypherpunks\" mailing list and has written about the importance of anonymity and encryption.\n\nHowever, some have questioned the authenticity of the evidence, suggesting that it could be a hoax. Wright has also been known to be a master of obfuscation and has a talent for keeping his personal life private.\n\nThe Australian authorities have raided Wright's home in Sydney as part of a tax investigation, but a spokesman for the Australian Federal Police said it had no connection to the Bitcoin reports. Wright has not commented on the allegations, and his involvement with Bitcoin remains a mystery.\n\nThe revelation of Wright's possible involvement with Bitcoin has significant implications for the cryptocurrency community and the world at large.

Australian police seem to be believers: They raided Wright's home in Sydney on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. Wired notes that Wright\u2014founder of supercomputing firm Cloudcroft, per Gizmodo\u2014blogged about releasing a \"cryptocurrency paper\" a few months before the Bitcoin white paper was revealed in November 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "**Hurricane Harvey and Climate Change: A Complex Issue**\n\nHurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston and surrounding areas, has raised questions about the role of climate change in intensifying the storm's impact. While scientists agree that climate change did not cause the storm, they note that warmer air and water mean wetter and possibly more intense hurricanes in the future.\n\n**Funding the Recovery**\n\nThe cost of recovery from the storm is expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars, and the issue of funding will test the nation's unity. In the past, Congress has faced partisan divides over funding for natural disasters, with some lawmakers demanding offsetting cuts in other programs. This approach has been criticized for undermining the core idea that government exists to help share risks that individuals and communities cannot reasonably bear alone.\n\n**Climate Change and Extreme Weather**\n\nClimate change is increasing the odds that storms will be more powerful and destructive. Scientists note that warmer oceans and air hold more moisture, leading to more intense precipitation events. While it is difficult to attribute any individual storm to climate change, the dominant scientific consensus is that climate change is a major factor in the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events.\n\n**Adapting to Climate Change**\n\nAdapting to climate change is a complex issue, and the idea that it is a simple alternative to mitigation is misleading. Adaptation has local costs and inequitable local benefits, whereas mitigation has local costs and egalitarian global benefits. Without mitigation, adaptation will only look uglier and uglier, more and more of a euphemism for abandoning poor people to their suffering.\n\n**The Future of Climate Change**\n\nClimate change is part of every story now, including Hurricane Harvey and Irma. The climate we live in shapes agriculture, cities, economies, trade, culture, and learning, and its changes are reflected in them. We need to find a way to weave the narratives of local stories and the larger narrative of climate change together while respecting and doing justice to both.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe media coverage of Hurricane Harvey has been criticized for politicizing the storm. Fox News, in particular, has been accused of whining about CNN's coverage, which dared to ask about the effect of climate change on the storm's intense rainfall. The Fox News hosts have been accused of hypocrisy, as they themselves have politicized the storm under the cover of playing the victim.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHurricane Harvey has highlighted the complex issue of climate change and its impact on extreme weather events. While scientists agree that climate change did not cause the storm,", "answers": ["As the deluge continues in Houston, one big question being debated is what role, if any, climate change played in the storm. As with most debates on climate change\u2014particularly when talking about a single weather event\u2014the views are all over the map. And some are suggesting that we need to frame the question differently to get the most accurate response. The details: Wrong question: Did climate change cause Harvey? That's not the right question, writes Dino Grandoni at the Washington Post. \"The better way to frame thinking about the connection is through the question: Does climate change make storms like Harvey more likely?\" This is a theme repeated in multiple posts on the subject, and Grandoni thinks the answer is yes, for reasons spelled out below. 'Worsened': One of the most cited pieces is from Penn State professor Michael Mann in the Guardian. \"We can't say that Hurricane Harvey was caused by climate change,\" he writes. \"But it was certainly worsened by it.\" The three big factors: Higher ocean levels made the storm surge worse, warmer water made the storm more intense, and Harvey stayed \"locked in place\" thanks to atmospheric changes brought on by humans. (The latter was the subject of a paper by Mann.) Maybe 'slightly': University of Washington atmospheric scientist Cliff Mass is skeptical the link is that strong. \"You really can't pin global warming on something this extreme,\" he tells Fox News. \"It has to be natural variability. It may juice it up slightly but not create this phenomenal anomaly.\" Link is 'unknown': Texas State climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon thinks it's too early to assess any link. \"The climate change impact on the strength of Harvey is unknown,\" he writes to CNN. \"Climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the strongest storms, but it's not clear whether Harvey was in that category.\" Still, he notes that heavier rain in general is a \"direct consequence\" of climate change, and Harvey certainly fits that pattern. Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions. All about the rain: The jury is out on whether climate change increases the frequency of hurricanes, writes David Roberts in a wide-ranging Q&A at Vox. But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes. In contrast, panelists on Fox's The Five spotted a CNN banner mentioning climate change and accused the network of pushing a liberal agenda. \"It's called the weather,\" said co-host Jesse Watters."]}

Cuypers and her team published their findings last week. They believe the results could be used to better train cadaver dogs or even create a machine that could do the same job.

This ice loss has contributed to a global sea level rise of about three-tenths of an inch (7.6 millimeters) over the past quarter century. The study, conducted by an international team of ice experts, used 24 different methods to analyze ice loss, including satellite data, ground and air measurements, and computer simulations.\n\nAccording to the study, the ice sheet in West Antarctica, where most of the melting occurred, is in a state of collapse. The team found that the melt rate increased from 84 billion tons per year (76 billion metric tons) from 1992 to 2011 to 241 billion tons per year (219 billion metric tons) from 2012 to 2017. This is a three-fold increase in just six years.\n\nThe study's lead author, Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds in England, warned that Antarctica alone could contribute about half a foot (16 centimeters) to sea level rise by the end of the century. He attributed the melting to climate change, citing warmer water nibbling at the floating edges of ice sheets from below, which is connected to shifting winds and global warming.\n\nThe study also found that East Antarctica is losing relatively little ice, about 31 tons (28 metric tons) per year since 2012, and was even gaining ice before 2012. However, scientists are not comfortable saying the trend in East Antarctica will continue, and it is likely due to natural variability rather than climate change.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research, which has shown that Antarctica's ice sheet is losing mass at an alarming rate. A separate study published in Nature on the same day found that the East Antarctic ice sheet did not retreat significantly 2 million to 5 million years ago when heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels were similar to what they are now.\n\nThe study's results have significant implications for global sea levels and coastal communities. As the ice sheet continues to melt, it will contribute to sea level rise, which will have devastating consequences for low-lying areas and coastal cities.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* 3 trillion tons of ice have disappeared from Antarctica since 1992\n", "answers": ["Scientists monitoring ice loss in Antarctica have chilling news: The melting rate has accelerated alarmingly and the ice sheet is now shedding more than 200 billion tons a year, according to a study involving 88 scientists published in the journal Nature.

Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"\u2014and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they\u2019re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that\u2019s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it\u2019s the area that we\u2019re most worried about, because it\u2019s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried. That doesn't mean we should be desperate,\" says study co-author Isabella Velicogna of the University of California Irvine, per the AP. \"Things are happening.

The overcrowding and unstable weather conditions on the mountain have led to a series of tragic incidents, including the death of at least 16 Sherpas in an avalanche on April 18th. This is the worst climbing accident in the history of Everest, and it has sparked outrage and demands for better compensation and working conditions for the Sherpas.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the commercialization of climbing on Everest, with many guides and expedition leaders prioritizing the safety of their clients over the well-being of the Sherpas. The Sherpas, who are paid relatively low wages and receive limited insurance benefits, are often forced to take on the most dangerous tasks on the mountain, including navigating the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.\n\nThe Nepali government has been criticized for its response to the tragedy, with many Sherpas demanding better compensation for the families of those who have died, as well as improved working conditions and benefits. The Sherpas have announced a strike unless their demands are met, which could potentially disrupt the remainder of the climbing season.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the growing trend of Everest becoming a spectator sport, with many climbers and guides prioritizing their own safety over the risks faced by the Sherpas. The use of bottled oxygen, dexamethasone, and other safety measures has reduced the risk of death for Western climbers, but has increased the burden on the Sherpas.\n\nThe statistics are stark: since 2000, 1,332 Sherpas have died on Everest, compared to 25 miners, 124 commercial fishermen, and 335 US military personnel in Iraq. The death rate for Sherpas on Everest is 12 times higher than for US military personnel in Iraq from 2003-2007.\n\nThe incident has sparked a renewed debate about the ethics of commercial climbing on Everest, and the need for greater regulation and oversight to protect the safety of both climbers and Sherpas. The Nepali government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, and many are calling for greater action to be taken to address the concerns of the Sherpas.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, many climbers and guides have retreated to base camp, and at least one expedition has announced that it will abandon the mountain. The Sherpas, who are the backbone of the climbing industry on Everest, are demanding better compensation and working conditions, and are threatening to go on strike unless their demands are met. The incident has highlighted", "answers": ["Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest (the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest\u2014one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen."]}

However, the screen resolution is not as high as the iPad's Retina display, and the battery life is not as long.\n\nThe Surface's operating system, Windows RT, is a variation of Windows 8, but it is not the full version of Windows. This means that it cannot run traditional Windows applications, and users are limited to a selection of apps available through the Windows Store. While the Surface comes with a range of built-in apps, including Office, the selection is limited compared to the iPad's app store.\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of the Surface is its keyboard, the Touch Cover, which is a flat, pressure-sensitive keyboard that can be prone to typos and finger placement errors.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "Researchers from the Czech Republic have conducted a study to determine if it is possible to accurately assess a person's intelligence by looking at their face. The study, published in the journal PLoS One, found that people can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men by viewing their faces in photographs, but not women. The researchers used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape.\n\nThe study found that faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are longer, with a wider distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. On the other hand, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin.\n\nHowever, the researchers found no correlation between these facial traits and actual IQ scores. They also found that the same effect was not present when they used female faces, suggesting that the ability to accurately assess intelligence from facial photographs may be due to the fact that attractiveness clouds the judgment of women's faces.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that people have an inbuilt ability to tell how intelligent a man is just by looking at him, but this ability does not work for women. The researchers propose several possible explanations for this, including the idea that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces, or that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness, which prevents an accurate assessment of their intelligence.\n\nThe study also found that people tend to associate certain facial traits with high intelligence, but these notions represent nothing but a cultural stereotype. The researchers used geometric morphometrics to determine which facial traits are associated with the perception of intelligence, and found that a clear mental image of what a smart face should look like exists within the community of human raters.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for our understanding of how we perceive intelligence and how it is associated with facial traits. They suggest that our ability to accurately assess intelligence from facial photographs may be influenced by cultural and social factors, and that the relationship between intelligence and facial traits is complex and multifaceted.\n\nOverall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between intelligence, facial traits, and attractiveness, and highlights the need for further research into the ways in which we perceive and assess intelligence.", "answers": ["It's easier to guess men's intelligence than women's just by looking at their faces\u2014maybe because we're so distracted by female beauty, according to a new study.

However, Stewart persevered and eventually brought in new writers, including Ben Karlin, who became the head writer and helped shape the show's tone and direction.\n\nUnder Stewart's leadership, The Daily Show began to focus more on satire and social commentary, rather than just making fun of eccentric individuals. The show's correspondents, including Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, and Mo Rocca, developed their own characters and styles, and the show's field pieces became more pointed and incisive.\n\nOne of the key moments that marked a turning point for the show was a segment in which Steve Carell asked Senator John McCain a question about his record on pork-barrel politics while on his bus, the Straight Talk Express.

The crisis began on March 11 when a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami struck Japan's northeastern coast, causing widespread destruction and triggering a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant.\n\n**Nuclear Crisis Deepens**\n\nThe situation at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant has worsened, with four of the six reactors experiencing fires, explosions, damage to the structures housing reactor cores, partial meltdowns, or rising temperatures. The storage pools used to store spent nuclear fuel are also a major concern, with water levels in at least one pool believed to be dangerously low, exposing the stored fuel rods to the risk of overheating and releasing radioactive material.\n\n**Desperate Efforts to Contain the Crisis**\n\nEmergency workers have been trying everything to contain the crisis, including using helicopters, water cannons, and firefighting trucks to dump water on the reactors. However, these efforts have shown few signs of working, and American officials have expressed concerns that the Japanese military's efforts are \"desperate\" and \"more prayer than plan.\" The U.S. has offered to help Japan with its efforts, including providing intelligence-collection aircraft to help map out the response to the crisis.\n\n**Radiation Fears Spread**\n\nRadiation levels have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. However, the crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life. The U.S. has warned its citizens to consider leaving the country and has offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, and Nagoya.\n\n**Global Response**\n\nThe international community has rallied around Japan, with the G7 nations intervening in global financial markets to calm the yen and the U.S. offering technical help at the nuclear site. The U.N. nuclear agency has described the situation as \"extremely serious\" and has called for international cooperation to help Japan deal with the crisis.\n\n**Humanitarian Crisis**\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Japan continues to worsen, with over 452,000 people staying in schools and other shelters, and supplies of fuel, medicine, and other necessities running short.

The discovery was made by Mike Brown, a renowned astronomer at Caltech, and his co-author Konstantin Batygin. According to their research, published in the Astronomical Journal, Planet Nine is estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun at an average distance of 20 times farther than Neptune. The planet's existence was inferred from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, which appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet.\n\nBrown, who is often referred to as the \"Pluto killer\" due to his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006, believes that Planet Nine is a significant discovery that could rewrite the textbooks on our solar system. He and Batygin initially set out to disprove the existence of a hidden planet, but their research revealed that the gravitational effects of a massive perturber were the most plausible explanation for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked excitement among astronomers, with some estimating that the odds of its existence are as high as 90%. However, others have cautioned that the evidence is still circumstantial and that further observations and detections of perturbed bodies are needed to confirm the hypothesis.\n\nBrown's discovery of Planet Nine has also reignited the debate over Pluto's status as a planet. While some scientists argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet, Brown believes that it is not a planet and that the controversy will eventually die down. He argues that the International Astronomical Union's decision to demote Pluto was necessary to establish a clear definition of a planet and to avoid having to consider hundreds or thousands of other small worlds as planets.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine and the ongoing debate over Pluto's status highlight the dynamic and evolving nature of our understanding of the solar system. As new discoveries are made and our knowledge of the universe expands, our understanding of the solar system will continue to change and evolve.\n\nIn related news, NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that the discovery of Planet Nine is still a long shot and that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\" However, he expressed excitement about the new research and the potential for future discoveries.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents searching for the", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

The spacecraft, launched in 2006, has traveled over 3 billion miles to reach the dwarf planet, which was once considered the ninth planet in our solar system but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\n**New Discoveries and Findings**\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft has already delivered data that is \"a gift for the ages,\" according to principal investigator Alan Stern. The data reveals that Pluto is larger than previously thought, with a diameter of 1,473 miles, and its interior contains more ice than rock. The spacecraft has also detected nitrogen escaping from Pluto's atmosphere, which could be a sign of a more complex atmospheric structure than previously thought.\n\n**The Flyby**\n\nThe flyby is a historic moment in the history of space exploration, marking the completion of the initial reconnaissance of the \"classical\" nine planets in our solar system. The spacecraft will pass by Pluto at 7:49 a.m. EDT, and the first high-resolution images will be released on Wednesday afternoon. The flyby will provide a close-up, detailed look at Pluto and its large moon Charon, as well as the smaller moons Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx.\n\n**The Mission**\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft is equipped with seven sophisticated instruments and has been traveling at a speed of over 30,000 miles per hour.

The finding suggests the planet contains a lot more ice and a lot less rock than thought, the Christian Science Monitor reports. There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Scientists hope the first close-up look at Pluto's surface will explain features like heart- and doughnut-shaped features recently spotted for the first time. LiveScience notes that new information from Pluto could help explain how our own planet formed and how life began. \"There's a feeling among scientists that Pluto probably will tell us what the early solar system looked like and it's now locked in deep freeze and maybe it will tell us what we once were, a long time ago,\" the director of the Deep Space Communication Complex tells Reuters. The Australian facility will be first to receive new information from the spacecraft. New Horizons isn't done.

Disney's stock is trading near its all-time high, driven by successful films like The Avengers and investments in theme parks and cruise lines. However, this success is not unique to Disney, as other studios are also focusing on big-budget films that can generate significant revenue through merchandising, TV spin-offs, and theme park attractions.\n\nMeanwhile, independent filmmakers are facing challenges in securing funding for mid-budget films. The cost of marketing a movie can be as high as 50% of the production budget, making it difficult for studios to justify smaller investments. As a result, the number of mid-budget films has decreased, and many filmmakers are struggling to make a living.\n\nDirectors like John Waters, David Lynch, and Francis Ford Coppola have expressed frustration with the current state of the industry, citing the difficulty in securing funding for their projects. Waters has said that he has four employees and cannot afford to make a film for a low budget, while Lynch has stated that he is too old for the current model. Coppola has self-financed his recent films, but notes that studios are no longer interested in taking risks on unique projects.\n\nThe shift towards big-budget films has led to a decrease in the number of studio films being released, while the number of independent films has increased. However, the indie scene is also facing challenges, with many filmmakers struggling to secure distribution and funding. The rise of streaming services has changed the way people consume movies, and many filmmakers are turning to television as a more viable option.\n\nDirectors like Steven Soderbergh, Cary Fukunaga, and Jill Soloway have found success in television, directing series like The Knick, True Detective, and Transparent. However, the budgets for these projects are often lower than those for films, and the storytelling format is different.\n\nIndustry experts predict that the current model may not be sustainable, with Steven Spielberg predicting an \"implosion\" of big-budget films and Ted Hope warning of a collapse of the foreign sales model.

Paramount's Titanic made that point in 1997 by costing $200 million and earning nearly $2.2 billion worldwide. At that time, mid-budget films like Kiss the Girls and In & Out dominated the Paramount slate and drew modest profits; this year, mega-flicks like Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rule Paramount's roost and earn the big bucks. \"You could make movies in the ten-to-twenty-million-dollar budget range\" at one time, says Susan Seidelman, director of Desperately Seeking Susan.

The plane's disappearance has sparked a massive search operation involving 24 countries, with the focus shifting from a search for wreckage to an investigation into the possible motives of the pilots and passengers.\n\n**Pilot Suicide Theory**\n\nThe possibility of pilot suicide has been raised as a theory, with some experts suggesting that one of the pilots may have deliberately crashed the plane. Mike Glynn, a committee member of the Australian and International Pilots Association, believes that pilot suicide is the most likely explanation for the plane's disappearance. The FBI has also investigated several cases of pilot suicide in the past, including the 1999 crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, where the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe investigation into the disappearance of Flight 370 has been ongoing for over a week, with Malaysian authorities searching the homes of the pilots and interviewing engineers who may have had contact with the plane before it took off. The flight simulator taken from the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah is being examined, and authorities are also looking into the backgrounds of the passengers to see if any of them were trained pilots.\n\n**Search Efforts**\n\nThe search for the plane has been extensive, with Indian and Malaysian authorities suspending their search operations until fresh search areas are identified. The Indian navy and air force have covered over 250,000 square kilometers in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal without any sighting of the plane.

Researchers from Leiden University in the Netherlands and the Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain conducted a study on 25 Spanish women who were scanned before and after their first pregnancies, as well as 20 women who did not get pregnant during the study. The results showed that pregnancy affects 11 locations in the brain, with reductions in volume of the brain's gray matter.\n\nThe changes were mostly still present two years after childbirth, based on follow-up with 11 study participants. The researchers believe that these changes are a result of sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman, which may lead to the pruning of brain cells and synapses. This process is similar to what happens during adolescence, where the brain becomes more specialized and efficient.\n\nThe study found that the brain changes are associated with an increase in emotional attachment to the infant and improved ability to understand the needs of the baby. The affected brain areas overlap with circuitry involved in figuring out what another person is thinking and feeling, which is a crucial ability for a mother tending to an infant.\n\nThe researchers used MRI scans to compare the brain structure of the women before and after pregnancy. They also gave the women memory tests, which showed no signs of decline. The study's findings suggest that the brain changes are a result of pregnancy rather than childbirth.\n\nThe study's lead author, Elseline Hoekzema, believes that the brain changes may be an adaptation to help women prepare for motherhood.

This discrepancy has sparked a new wave of interest in the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which make up 95% of the universe but do not emit light.\n\nThe study, led by Nobel laureate Adam Riess, used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond the Milky Way.

The new measurements have a margin of error of just 2.4%, making them the most accurate ever.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. If the discrepancy holds up, it could mean that dark energy, a mysterious force thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the universe's expansion, is more powerful than previously thought. Alternatively, it could mean that Einstein's theory of general relativity is incomplete or inaccurate.\n\nOther possible explanations for the discrepancy include the presence of unknown subatomic particles, such as dark radiation, which could be pushing galaxies apart at high speeds.

If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of Einstein's theory of relativity, reports the Guardian. \"If you really believe our number\u2014and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties\u2014then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" says co-author Alex Filippenko of Berkeley, per the Christian Science Monitor. While 5% to 9% may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \"major discrepancy\" in this particular case, notes Gizmodo. Part of the answer around the discrepancy may lie in the \"mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" says another of the project's researchers.

The incident has sparked widespread outrage and debate, with many questioning the zoo's decision to shoot the gorilla and others criticizing the parents for their lack of supervision.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the boy climbed through a barrier and fell 12 feet into the moat surrounding the gorilla exhibit. The gorilla, Harambe, grabbed and dragged the boy through the water, with the crowd's screams and commotion agitating the animal. Despite initial reports that Harambe was trying to help the boy, the situation escalated, and the gorilla began to aggressively pull the boy back into its body.\n\nThe zoo's Dangerous Animal Response Team, trained and certified annually by the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office, made the difficult decision to shoot Harambe to save the child's life.

However, the cause of its sinking has been a mystery for over 150 years. Researchers have proposed various theories, including suffocation, damage to the hull from arms fire, and a lucky shot from a stray bullet. \n\nA new study published in PLoS One suggests that the crew of the Hunley died instantly from the shockwave generated by their own torpedo. The study, led by biomechanist Rachel Lance, used a 1/6 scale model of the Hunley to test the effects of the blast wave on the crew. The results showed that the shockwave would have caused catastrophic injuries to the crew's soft tissues, especially their brains and lungs, and would have left no mark on the skeletal remains.\n\nLance's research involved constructing a scale model of the Hunley and subjecting it to pressurized air blasts and black powder explosions while monitoring the effects with sensors. She also analyzed the effects of energy blasts on the human respiratory system and pored through documents at the National Archives in Washington. The study found that the blast wave would have traveled through the soft tissues of the crew's bodies, causing pulmonary trauma and traumatic brain injuries.\n\nThe Hunley's crew had set off a 61.2 kg (135 lb) black powder torpedo at a distance of less than 5 m (16 ft) off its bow, which caused a massive explosion that sank the Union ship Housatonic. The crew of the Hunley was never heard from again, and their fate was finally revealed in 1995 when the sunken sub was found near Charleston Harbor in South Carolina.\n\nLance's study provides new insights into the physiology of human beings and the physical forces we can endure.

Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai.

Plus there's all that inexpensive land. Ukraine's interest in renewables is partly politically motivated given the fragile cease-fire with Kremlin-backed rebels near the Russian border, not to mention increasing friction with the Putin camp over natural gas bills.

A recent report by Amnesty International revealed that Iran has continued to execute juvenile offenders, despite being one of the few countries that still practices this form of punishment. The report, titled \"Growing Up on Death Row: The Death Penalty and Juvenile Offenders in Iran,\" highlighted the plight of 73 juvenile offenders who were executed between 2005 and 2015. According to the UN, at least 160 juvenile offenders are currently on death row, with many having spent years in prison awaiting their fate.\n\nThe Iranian government has made some attempts to reform its laws, introducing a new Islamic Penal Code in 2013 that allows judges to assess a juvenile offender's mental maturity at the time of the crime. However, these reforms have been criticized for being piecemeal and failing to abolish the death penalty for juvenile offenders altogether.\n\nIran's treatment of children has also been criticized by the international community. The country has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but has made a reservation that allows it to ignore the treaty if it conflicts with Islamic law. This has led to concerns that the government is not taking its obligations under the treaty seriously.\n\nIn addition to the issue of juvenile offenders, Iran has also been criticized for its treatment of women and children in general. A recent report by the Iranian government's own human rights commission found that women and children are disproportionately affected by poverty and lack of access to education and healthcare.\n\nThe case of Mahsa, a 17-year-old girl who killed her father in a fit of anger, has highlighted the harsh treatment of children in Iran. Mahsa's brothers are requesting the death penalty for her, which has sparked outrage among human rights activists. The case has also raised questions about the effectiveness of Iran's juvenile justice system and the need for greater protection for children's rights.\n\nOverall, Iran's human rights record remains a major concern, particularly when it comes to the treatment of children.

The plan would cover a wide range of benefits, including hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, and prescription drugs, as well as vision and dental benefits.\n\nThe bill has been met with both support and skepticism from Democrats, with some senators expressing concerns about the cost and feasibility of implementing such a system. However, the plan has gained traction among the public, with a recent poll showing that 53% of Americans support a national health care plan.\n\nThe Sanders plan would be funded through a progressive tax system, with the richest households paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, among others. Existing health care expenditures would also contribute to the plan. According to Sanders, his plan would save the American people and businesses $6 trillion over the next decade.\n\nWhile there is evidence to support the notion that a single-payer system is more cost-effective than the current model, the exact savings under Sanders' plan are a topic of debate. Republicans and even some moderate Democrats have expressed concerns about the high costs of implementing a single-payer system and the potential impact on employer-provided coverage.\n\nDespite these concerns, the idea of Medicare for All has become a litmus test for Democratic presidential hopefuls, with several potential candidates, including Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker, co-sponsoring the bill.

One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity\u2014the government\u2014pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance.

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."]}

The change led to the contamination of the water with lead, causing permanent brain damage in children and other health problems.\n\nIn addition to the lead contamination, there has been a significant increase in Legionnaires' disease cases in Genesee County, where Flint is located.

In Pennsylvania, a judge ruled that two men who texted a driver during a fatal accident can be held liable for the accident, setting a precedent that third-party texters can be held accountable if they are aware the driver is texting and will view the text while on the road. This decision follows a 2013 New Jersey appellate ruling that established the same cause of action against third parties in motor vehicle accident litigation.\n\nIn a separate case, a New York driver who was injured in a car accident caused by a distracted driver is suing Snapchat for \"motivating\" the driver to drive recklessly. The driver, Wentworth Maynard, was put in a coma and suffered permanent brain damage after being hit by the distracted driver, who was trying to reach 100 mph on a Snapchat-filter speedometer.\n\nMeanwhile, New York lawmakers have proposed a \"textalyzer\" bill that would allow police officers to take phones from drivers after accidents and determine whether they were using the phone in a way that isn't in accordance with state laws. The bill also proposes that drivers would be forced to hand over their phone after a wreck or risk a driver's license suspension.\n\nExperts believe that these developments could signal a shift in how society views distracted driving, making it less socially acceptable and potentially leading to a decrease in distracted driving incidents.

According to the report, the CEOs of America's top 350 companies earned 312 times more than their workers on average last year. This pay gap has been increasing steadily since the 1990s, with some fluctuations. In 1965, the ratio of CEO to worker pay was 20 to one, which rose to 58 to one by 1989 and peaked in 2000 at 344 times the wage of their average worker.\n\nThe report also notes that CEO pay has been rising rapidly since 2009, with some CEOs earning millions of dollars in compensation. For example, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook earned $21.7 million in 2017, while the average McDonald's worker earned just $7,017. Similarly, Walmart's CEO Doug McMillon earned $22.8 million in 2017, while the average Walmart worker earned $19,177.\n\nThe EPI report attributes the rise in CEO pay to the increasing use of stock-related components of compensation, such as stock awards and realized stock options. These components accounted for nearly all of the growth in CEO compensation from 2016 to 2017, with the value of exercised stock options growing by 47.1 percent.\n\nThe report also notes that the pay gap between CEOs and workers has been fueled by the growth of top 1 percent incomes. According to a study by Jon Bakija, Adam Cole, and Bradley Heim, the increases in income among the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent of households were disproportionately driven by households headed by someone who was either a nonfinancial-sector \"executive\" or a financial-sector worker.\n\nThe EPI report concludes that the escalation of CEO compensation has fueled the growth of top 1 percent incomes and has contributed to the widening pay gap between CEOs and workers. The report recommends several policy options to reverse the trend of excessive executive pay and broaden wage growth, including implementing higher marginal income tax rates at the very top, setting corporate tax rates higher for firms with higher ratios of CEO-to-worker compensation, and changing corporate governance practices to limit executive pay growth.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the need for policymakers to address the growing pay gap between CEOs and workers and to implement policies that promote more equitable compensation practices.\n\nKey statistics:\n\n* CEOs of America's top 350 companies earned 312 times more than their workers on average last year.\n* The pay gap", "answers": ["For every dollar made by the average Facebook employee, Mark Zuckerberg earned $37 in 2017.

Per the Guardian, such an \"astronomical gap\" hasn't been seen since the eve of the 2007 financial crisis. The 17.6% increase in average CEO pay, compared to 0.3% for workers, had a lot to do with a booming stock market, but it's also part of a larger trend. Since 2009, average CEO pay has risen 72%, compared to about 2% for workers, who now make $54,600 on average. \"It speaks to the degree the economic recovery is unbalanced,\" report co-author Larry Mishel tells the Washington Post, which describes CEO-to-worker pay ratios of 3,101-to-1 for McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook and 1,188-to-1 for Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. \"Had there not been the redistribution upward \u2026 the wages of the bottom 90% could have grown twice as fast as it actually did,\" Mishel tells the Guardian.

Despite his best efforts to control his addiction, he lost over $4 million and eventually took his own life.\n\nStevens' story is not unique. According to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, 1.1 to 1.6 percent of the adult population in the United States has a gambling disorder, which translates to approximately 3 million to 4 million Americans. The industry has been accused of designing slot machines to be addictive, with features such as near misses, uneven distribution of winning symbols, and losses disguised as wins.\n\n**The Business Plan for Casinos**\n\nCasinos have developed a business plan that relies on addicted gamblers. They use loyalty cards, ATMs, and other tools to track players' behavior and target them with customized perks and VIP treatment. The goal is to get players to exceed their limits and lose more money. The industry has developed formulas to calculate the \"predicted lifetime value\" of individual gamblers, with the biggest losers referred to as \"whales.\"\n\n**The Technology Behind Slot Machines**\n\nModern slot machines are highly sophisticated, with complex algorithms and virtual reel mapping.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings\u2014until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back.

The study, which analyzed data from over 30,000 twins, discovered that the \"geek index\" - a measure of non-verbal IQ, focus, and social aloofness - was higher in sons of older fathers. In fact, the study found that for every five years of paternal age, the geek index score increased by about 1.5 points.\n\nThe researchers, led by Magdalena Janecka from King's College London, suggest that the link between older fathers and geekier sons may be due to the fact that older men are more likely to have higher levels of \"geekiness\" themselves. Men who delay fatherhood often do so due to their extended career and educational pursuits, and are likely to display higher levels of \"geekiness.\"\n\nThe study also found that the benefits of having an older father were strongest in boys, with girls seeming to be immune to the effects. However, the researchers note that this may be due to the fact that the measure of geekiness used in the study may not capture the ways in which geekiness manifests in girls.\n\nWhile the study's findings are intriguing, they do not necessarily mean that men should delay fatherhood in order to have more intelligent sons. In fact, the researchers caution that the risks associated with older fatherhood, such as an increased risk of autism and schizophrenia, should not be ignored.\n\nThe study's lead author, Magdalena Janecka, notes that the findings should not be taken to guide individual decisions about parenthood. \"Those findings should definitely not be taken to guide individual decisions about parenthood,\" she says. \"Effects we are describing are visible in large samples, but may operate very differently in cases of individual families.\"\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate about the potential benefits of older fatherhood.

The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older. The impact was less pronounced on girls, and more pronounced when measuring science, tech, engineering, and math scores. Kids born to fathers 50 or older were 32% more likely to earn at least two A's on standardized tests than children born to men aged under 25, the researchers report in Translational Psychiatry.

Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \"crunch time.\" Hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including West Nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of Zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related Zika reported there, per the Shreveport Times. But another expert isn't so sure about the Zika risk. Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, Zika is already affecting the Bayou State in another way: Per KENS, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to Zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

According to the California Attorney General's database, there are currently 35 people listed as missing in the county, with some cases dating back to 1977. However, a closer examination of the data reveals that many of these cases are not as straightforward as they seem.\n\nOne case that recently gained attention is that of Rebekah Martinez, a 22-year-old woman who was reported missing in November 2017 by her mother. However, it was later discovered that Martinez was actually a contestant on the reality TV show \"The Bachelor.\" Her case highlights the issue of people intentionally going off the grid and not wanting to be found.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office attributes the high rate of missing persons to the local cannabis industry, which attracts people from all over the country and can lead to individuals going off the grid for extended periods. However, this explanation is not the only factor contributing to the high rate of missing persons.\n\nThe county's high rate of missing children is also a concern, with an average of 490 missing children reports annually for every 100,000 residents, compared to the state average of 280. However, many of these cases are resolved within days or weeks, and the majority of missing children are runaways.\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) has stated that Humboldt County is not on their radar, and that the county's high rate of missing children is largely due to the high number of runaway foster youth in the area. However, the county's rates of missing children under \"unknown circumstances\" are higher than the state average.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Eureka Police Department have emphasized that many missing persons cases are resolved quickly, and that the majority of missing individuals are found within a few days. However, some cases remain unsolved, and families of missing individuals often face frustration and challenges in searching for their loved ones.\n\nOne such case is that of Jeff Joseph, a dispensary owner who disappeared in 2014 while visiting his farm in Weitchpec. His sister, Vikki Joseph, has been searching for him for years and has found community with other families whose loved ones disappeared under suspicious circumstances related to the cannabis industry.

The strange story started when Bekah Martinez's mom reported her missing to the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office on Nov. 18. According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don\u2019t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person.

The event aims to bring together 150 engineers, designers, parents, public health researchers, and lactation consultants to brainstorm innovative solutions to the current problems with breast pumps. These problems include a loud motor, too many parts, difficulty in cleaning, inability to pump while lying down, lack of space to pump, and social stigma associated with breast pumping.\n\nThe hackathon is a response to the lack of innovation in maternal health, which is an area that \"lags behind others\" in terms of innovation. The event is also inspired by the fact that breast pumping is an experience that many women hate, yet it saves the lives of premature babies and allows working women to continue nursing their babies.\n\nThe breast pump is a symbol of the modern work-life conundrum, where women are expected to balance their careers and family responsibilities. However, the current design of breast pumps is often loud, painful, and embarrassing, making it difficult for women to feel empowered and confident.\n\nThe hackathon is not just about improving breast pumps, but also about making space for innovation in family life more broadly. The event is open to anyone who wants to contribute, and participants can submit their ideas and projects online. The hackathon is sponsored by several organizations, including Vecna Technologies, Pejman Mar Ventures, Medela, and Naia Health.\n\nThe event has already generated a lot of interest, with over 150 people registered to attend. The hackathon will feature a variety of projects, including Compress Express, a breast pump that mimics the natural process of hand expression; Second Nature, a breast pump that mimics the way a baby suckles; and PumpIO, an open software and hardware platform to make the breast pumping experience smarter and more data-rich.\n\nThe hackathon is not just about creating new products, but also about raising awareness about the importance of maternal health and the need for innovation in this area. The event is a step towards creating a more supportive and empowering environment for working mothers and their families.\n\nIn related news, a couple, Courtney and John, have written about their experiences with breast pumps and how they are outdated and embarrassing.

Snowden, 30, had been hiding in Hong Kong for several weeks before boarding a flight to Moscow, where he was expected to seek asylum in Ecuador.\n\nSnowden's journey began when he revealed to The Guardian and The Washington Post that the NSA had been collecting vast amounts of phone and internet data from American citizens and foreigners. The US government charged Snowden with espionage, and he was subsequently stripped of his US passport.\n\nSnowden's next move was to book a flight from Moscow to Havana, Cuba, but he did not show up on the flight, leading to a massive media frenzy. Journalists from around the world had booked seats on the flight, hoping to catch a glimpse of Snowden, but he was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe US government has been pressuring Russia to hand over Snowden, but the Russian government has denied any knowledge of his whereabouts. Ecuador's Foreign Minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, said that his government was considering Snowden's asylum request and had provided him with a \"refugee document of passage\" to facilitate his travel.\n\nThe US Secretary of State, John Kerry, expressed frustration that Hong Kong allowed Snowden to leave despite a US request for his detention. Kerry said that it would be \"deeply troubling\" if Russia or Hong Kong had adequate notice of Snowden's plans and still allowed him to leave.\n\nSnowden's case has sparked a diplomatic row between the US and several countries, including Russia, China, and Ecuador. The US has revoked Snowden's passport and is seeking his extradition, but it is unclear where he is currently.\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been involved in Snowden's case, helping to arrange his travel documents and advising him on his asylum request. Assange has described Snowden as a \"hero\" and has accused the US government of trying to silence him.\n\nThe situation is ongoing, with Snowden's next move still unknown. The US government is continuing to pressure Russia and other countries to hand over Snowden, while Snowden's supporters are advocating for his asylum and protection.\n\nKey players involved in the case include:\n\n* Edward Snowden: The former NSA contractor who leaked classified information about the US government's surveillance programs.\n* Julian Assange: The founder of WikiLeaks, who has been involved in Snowden's case and has helped to arrange his travel documents.\n* John Kerry: The US Secretary of State, who has expressed", "answers": ["Edward Snowden spent the night in Moscow's airport and was expected to fly to Cuba today\u2014but American authorities are making it clear that they'd prefer that the NSA whistleblower was enjoying their hospitality instead.

The airline Aeroflot told the AP he was booked on a Moscow-Havana flight this morning (the expectation being he'd then travel to Venezuela and then to Ecuador, where WikiLeaks says he will seek asylum), prompting a number of journalists to grab seats on said flight. But Snowden apparently never boarded, reports Business Insider via an article with this headline: \"Russia Just Punked a Bunch of Journalists Who Are Now On Their Way to Havana.\" AP Moscow correspondent Max Seddon confirmed that there was no sign of Snowden, tweeting, \"Cuba here we come. Taxiing down Sheremetevo runway and no sign of Snowden. Seats empty still by 17A.\" How did Snowden get out of Hong Kong yesterday to begin with? Despite the Chinese territory's autonomy, the final decision came from Beijing, sources tell the New York Times. The move lets China save face while avoiding a drawn-out extradition battle. Some legal experts are telling the New York Times the US government goofed in waiting until Saturday to revoke Snowden's passport, though charges were filed June 14. Says a former federal prosecutor, \"They missed an opportunity to freeze him in place.\" Still, the Times notes that Snowden may have still been able to fly to Moscow sans passport thanks to special refugee travel documents from Ecuador that WikiLeaks helped Snowden obtain."]}

The investigation also revealed that the website Armslist.com was transferring over 25,000 guns to individuals with criminal records in a single year.\n\nIn 2011, the coalition released a report showing that states and federal agencies were failing to submit millions of records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), allowing substance abusers, the mentally ill, and other dangerous individuals to purchase firearms.\n\n**Legislative Efforts**\n\nMayors Against Illegal Guns has been actively working with lawmakers to pass legislation to strengthen the nation's gun background check system. In 2011, the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2011 was introduced in the House of Representatives, which aimed to close gaps in the background check system that allowed criminals to obtain firearms. The bill was supported by President Obama, who called for an \"instant, accurate, and comprehensive\" background check system.\n\nThe coalition has also opposed legislation that would override state laws on concealed carry, arguing that it would put loaded guns in the hands of individuals who are too dangerous to qualify for a local permit.\n\n**Public Awareness Campaigns**\n\nMayors Against Illegal Guns has launched several public awareness campaigns to raise awareness about gun violence and the need for stronger background checks. In 2011, the coalition launched a national drive to fix gun checks, which included a billboard truck that traveled across the country to raise awareness about gun crime. The coalition has also released several television ads, including a Super Bowl ad featuring mayors Bloomberg and Menino, and a PSA featuring 30 mayors demanding action from Congress.\n\n**Support from Survivors and Families**\n\nThe coalition has received support from survivors and families of gun violence victims, including those affected by the Tucson shooting.

The attack, which was carried out by two gunmen, was the worst on foreigners in Tunisia since an Al-Qaeda suicide bombing on a synagogue in 2002.\n\nThe gunmen, identified as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaoui, stormed the museum, which is a popular tourist attraction and a major cultural site, at around noon. They opened fire on tourists as they were getting out of buses, killing several people instantly. The attackers then took hostages inside the museum, but were killed by security forces two hours later.\n\nThe victims of the attack included tourists from Japan, Italy, Poland, Spain, Australia, France, and the UK, among others.

President Beji Caid Essebsi also vowed to \"wipe out\" the \"barbarous groups\" responsible for the attack.\n\nThe attack has raised concerns about the security situation in Tunisia, which has been struggling to deal with the threat of terrorism. The country has seen a number of militant groups emerge since the 2011 uprising that overthrew the autocratic government of Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali. Many Tunisians have also joined extremist groups in Iraq and Syria, and there are fears that they may return to carry out attacks at home.\n\nIn response to the attack, the Tunisian government has increased security measures, including deploying the army to major cities. The country's tourism industry, which is a major source of revenue, has also been affected, with several tour operators suspending trips to Tunisia.\n\nThe international community has rallied around Tunisia, with the US, EU, and other countries offering their support and condolences.

He also discussed his relationship with the media, stating that he has a good relationship with many media moguls, including Rupert Murdoch and Leslie Moonves. Trump's campaign has been marked by controversy, including violent clashes between protesters and police at his rallies. Despite this, Trump remains optimistic about his chances of winning the presidency.\n\n**Passage 2: Funding Freeze for UNRWA**\n\nThe Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides aid to Palestinian refugees. The move is seen as a pressure tactic to get the Palestinians to return to peace talks with Israel. However, a State Department official stated that the funding was not frozen, but rather, there are still deliberations taking place. The Israeli government has expressed concerns about the potential consequences of cutting funding to UNRWA, which could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\n**Passage 3: Michael Wolff's Book on the Trump White House**\n\nAuthor and columnist Michael Wolff has written a book about his experiences in the Trump White House, based on extensive access to the administration and over 200 interviews with Trump and senior staff.

The review, the largest post-conviction review ever done by the FBI, will include cases conducted by all FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners since at least 1985 and may reach earlier if records are available. The review comes after The Washington Post reported in April that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people but had not performed a thorough review of the cases.\n\nThe review will include help from the Innocence Project, a New York-based advocacy group for people seeking exoneration through DNA testing, and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The review will focus on cases where FBI examiners gave flawed testimony, including those who overstated forensic matches in ways that favored prosecutors in more than 95% of the 268 trials reviewed so far.

{"dataset_name": "multi_news_e", "pred_str": "The Independence Day weekend box office did not favor the new movie releases, with The Legend of Tarzan and The BFG performing poorly. The BFG, directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the Roald Dahl novel, earned $24 million on a $140 million budget, making it a commercial failure. The movie's poor performance can be attributed to several factors, including its confusing title, lack of recognizable faces, and failure to appeal to both children and adults. The film's visual effects and Mark Rylance's performance as the Big Friendly Giant were praised, but the movie's inability to balance its tone and lack of a clear target audience may have contributed to its poor box office performance.\n\nThe BFG's box office performance was also affected by the strong competition from other movies, including Finding Dory, which took the top spot with a $41.9 million gross. The movie's poor performance has raised questions about Spielberg's ability to make a successful family film, with some analysts suggesting that he hasn't had a hit since Hook in 1991.\n\nThe BFG's performance has also been compared to other Spielberg films, with some analysts suggesting that it may be the first commercial bomb in his career that was intended as a crowd-pleaser. However, Spielberg's overall track record as a filmmaker is still impressive, with a batting average of making films that are profitable or near-profitable.\n\nThe movie's poor performance has also been attributed to its high production budget of $140 million, which may have been a risk given the lack of a built-in audience for the Roald Dahl book. The film's reliance on overseas markets to recover its losses may not be enough to save it from being considered a commercial failure.\n\nOverall, The BFG's poor box office performance is a disappointment for Spielberg and Disney, but it is not a reflection of the director's overall talent or ability to make successful films.", "answers": ["With a $140 million budget and an opening weekend take of only $24 million, The BFG is poised to be Steven Spielberg's biggest flop in 37 years, Rolling Stone reports. That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d"]}

The study, which involved 3,432 UK university staff and students aged 18-40, found that those bereaved by suicide were 65% more likely to attempt suicide than those bereaved by natural causes. This brings the absolute risk up to 1 in 10.\n\nThe study also found that those bereaved by suicide were 80% more likely to drop out of education or work, with 8% of the people bereaved by suicide having dropped out of an educational course or a job since the death. The researchers suggest that addressing the social stigma attached to suicide bereavement might be one way to help limit its impact on people's lives.\n\nThe study's findings highlight the profound impact that suicide can have on friends and family members, and emphasize that these outcomes are not inevitable. The researchers stress that people bereaved by suicide should not be made to feel responsible for the death and should be treated with the same compassion as those bereaved by any other cause.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Alexandra Pitman, notes that people can find it difficult to know what to say to someone who has recently been bereaved, but suggests that saying something is often better than saying nothing, and simple gestures like offering practical help with day-to-day activities can mean a lot.\n\nThe study's findings also suggest that a history of suicide among non-blood relatives and friends should be considered when assessing suicide risk, in addition to family history of suicide. The study was published in the journal BMJ Open.\n\nThe researchers also note that people who have been bereaved by suicide tend to perceive more social stigma around the death, and that addressing this stigma might be a way to help limit its impact on people's lives. They suggest that employers should be aware of the significant impact that suicide bereavement has on people's working lives and make adjustments to help their staff return to work.\n\nOverall, the study's findings emphasize the importance of providing support to people who have been bereaved by suicide, and highlight the need to address the social stigma attached to suicide bereavement.", "answers": ["Dealing with death is difficult enough, but when a loved one takes his or her own life, it becomes even more complex\u2014and it may up the risk of suicide for those left behind, a new study finds. In their findings published in the BMJ Open journal, researchers from University College London studied 3,432 adults ages 18 to 40 who'd been bereaved by a sudden death of a friend or family member. They found that individuals whose deceased loved ones had killed themselves were 65% more likely to attempt suicide themselves (what NDTV refers to as the phenomenon of \"suicide contagion\") than those affected by a loved one's sudden death by natural causes\u2014or 1 in 10 people in that segment, per a press release. And having someone close to you die by suicide was found to have other repercussions, too: The study discovered that those affected by suicidal deaths were 80% more likely to leave a work or educational situation, per the release. \"Our results highlight the profound impact that suicide might have on friends and family members,\" study author Dr. Alexandra Pitman says in the release. And the social stigma around suicide may be a significant factor affecting a mourning person's outlook. \"Suicide in particular is often perceived as a taboo subject,\" Pitman notes. \"Avoiding the subject can make a bereaved person feel very isolated and stigmatized, and sometimes even blamed for the death.\" That's not to say, though, that having such a tragedy afflict a family member or close friend dooms a person to a similar sad fate. \"These outcomes are by no means inevitable,\" Pitman says. \"If you have been bereaved by suicide, you should know that are not alone and support is available.\" (A Marine unit has lost 14 members to suicide.)"]}

He then pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda's overall leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in an effort to reassure Syrians that the group remains dedicated to the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe merger has significant implications for the Syrian conflict, as Jabhat al-Nusra is widely regarded as the most effective fighting force in Syria, with thousands of disciplined fighters and a strong presence in rebel-held territory. The group has been responsible for numerous high-profile attacks against Syrian government forces and has been accused of human rights abuses.\n\nThe merger also raises concerns about the potential for Al-Qaeda to establish a safe haven in Syria, which could allow the group to plan and execute attacks against the West. The Obama administration has been cautious in its support for the Syrian opposition, fearing that arms and aid could fall into the hands of extremist groups like Al-Nusra.\n\nIn response to the merger, the Obama administration is expected to announce a new package of non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition, including body armor and night-vision goggles. However, the administration has been criticized for its slow response to the crisis, with some rebel leaders accusing it of doing too little to support the opposition.\n\nThe Syrian government has seized on the merger as evidence of its claims that the opposition is a foreign-backed terrorist plot. The government has been accused of using the merger to justify its brutal crackdown on civilians and opposition activists.\n\nAs the conflict continues to escalate, the people of Syria have reason to worry about the implications of the merger. The opposition is fractured and divided, with some groups openly hostile to the United States. The Obama administration's decision to provide non-lethal aid to the opposition is seen as an effort to bolster groups separate from Al-Nusra", "answers": ["The head of Jabhat al-Nusra, a jihadist group at the forefront of Syria's civil war, has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda honcho Ayman al-Zawahiri. What that means isn't exactly crystal clear at this point. While Al-Qaeda in Iraq says the groups have merged under the snappy title of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, al-Nusra chief Abu Mohammed al-Jawalani denies his group will be ordering new letterhead just yet, the BBC reports. \"The banner of the Front will remain unchanged despite our pride in the banner of the State and those who carried it and sacrificed and shed their blood for it,\" he said in an audio message, the AP reports. Al-Nusra is among the most effective of the rebel groups fighting the Syrian government. It has committed more than 40 successful bombing attacks and has been on the frontline of clashes against Assad forces, adds the Daily Beast. The alliance is not a surprise (Obama labeled it a terrorist organization last year), but it is concerning, says CNN. Al-Nusra's success on the battlefield and reputation for distributing free bread makes it popular with everyday Syrians. With a powerful army in Syria, al-Qaeda would gain a strong strategic position in the Middle East, and a safe haven for long-term scheming."]}
